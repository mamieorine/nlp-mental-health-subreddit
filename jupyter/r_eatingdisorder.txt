trusted and told everything to. recently, we've stopped being friends due to some other issues. but i had been looking back on our friendship and realized how much of a bad friend she was.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\ni suffered from restrictive eating disorders since i was 12 and then it got bad during a spike in my anxiety and ocd when i was 16 (junior in hs). there were various events that caused me to develop anorexia because my ocd took control of my life and restricting the food i ate was like the one way i felt that i was in control of my life.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nwhen i was starting to recover from it about a year later, i was tackling my fear foods, eating more regularly, and began to stop feeling food panic. so i started to hang out with friends i hadn't seen in a while, due to my ed and depression. i was hanging out with this one friend who i knew during middle school and got the courage to tell her about my ed. she instead ignored me and glossed over it like it was nothing. i honestly didn't care because it wasn't like i had wanted her to make a huge deal out of it anyways.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhowever, it always seemed like she would forget the fact that i told her about my ed. she never would pay attention to anything i said and would make every conversation about her, so that explained that. i didn't want her to think of me as the ed girl but i also wanted her to have remembered what i told her.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nit just made me mad because she would always tell me that we should go on diets together, like going vegan, which was one of the diets i did that facilitated my ed. and i told her this. i told her i had a really bad ed where i would lose more than the recommended number of pounds a week, not to mention a day. she would just make little comments and i would start going down that path again.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\none of the things that made me revert back to my ed was when she would show me pictures of plus size models and say \"you could be like that.\" this always happened after covid lockdown when i had gained a lot of weight due to depression and traumatic events. i was already not happy with my body size and then she would show me plus size models (which is good for them. they're killing it) and tell me i could be confident. it just reminded me that she saw me as \"big\" which i always feared people would see me as. i know it doesn't seem like a lot, but it was a trigger and i would hesitate to eat after she would say it cause her comments would be on my mind for a while.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nnow i'm doing better. i've started to fully recover and she's not in my life anymore so there's no more of that added stress. i'm really trying and sometimes it's hard cause the thoughts just never leave.",

Lipedema. It's a fat disorder. It differs from regular obesity as it does not respond to diet and exercise. But having it sucks because not many Drs are aware of it or know how to help you.\n\nMine has been misdiagnosed as obesity for 17 years. My weight is a life long struggle. And I've been battling some kind of eating disorder but I had no clue that it was serious because I thought since I was still obese that there was no way I was starving myself and if I truly was, then I'd be skinny. Like I just thought I was crazy. If my diet was unsafe then I'd probably be losing more weight. And that kept me in denial.\n\nMy diagnoses sort of kicked up my ED behaviors but at the same time it made me admit I do actually have a problem and it's not just in my head. I have been dealing with many of the effects of having an eating disorder but I'm in denial because my BMI is over 40 and like nobody would ever believe me if I told them.\n\n I'm afraid to say hey guys I have ___ because I don't fit the mold and I'm not skinny what so ever. And there were times I did get better. I was in an institution where they fed me lots of calories and when I got sober at first I ate a lot for like 5 months. I got to my highest weight ever and I was just like omg I am out of control.\n\nSo I started \"dieting\" again but it quickly turned into a game like the calorie goal kept getting lower. \n\nWhen I was in my early 20s I starved myself for a year and got to my lowest adult weight. But any time I ate normal I would start gaining weight. And I had issues where I'd eat what I decided was too much. So I did used to purge. And make myself burn more calories. I always fidget and rock and move. I used to do cardio but something changed and I can't anymore.\n\nSo this time around I knew I had to lose weight somehow. So I decided to try dieting again even though I feared things going back to how they were before\n I knew there were times when I was unhealthier but I couldn't really identify why it was.\n\nBut it quickly turned from a diet into something worse again. That little voice that told me to stop eating and starve my body from calories so I wouldn't gain. So I could try and lose. But it never worked. That stupid little voice. I have a mirror facing my bed so everytime I get up and out I can look at myself and remember why I don't wanna eat too much. And I get so starving I have to eat and then I tell myself it's bad food and feel guilty.\n\nI decided to do intermittent fasting sinve so many recommend it. So I started with 16/8. But it turned into 24 X3 days a week. Then 5. Over time the fasting got longer. I didn't lose like a lot of weight though. I tried very hard to only lose 30 pounds in a year. I restricted more than what is recommended and according to my bmr and bmi I should have been losing at least 2 pounds a week or more even if I rate 1300 calories. So I'd aim for 0 and then allow myself 300-500 for my omad if it was an eating day.\n\n I mean on a bad day I'd eat over 1,000 calories and feel so guilty. But a good day I wouldn't eat food at all. And eventually it was two days. Then l let myself eat food because you do need it to survive they say and I'm sure it's worse to starve harder. I don't have the willpower to starve longer than 48 hours. But for some reason that's just not what happened. And it could be the whole starvation mode thing or that eating disorders won't actually help me lose weight. \n\nBut a little voice tells me I don't deserve a normal amount of food. I'm not skinny enough to get help. And I never will be. But a coach on YouTube made a video that was my wake up on call. I have so many side effects from this. \n\nIn the past years I've been to the er for c diff, ecoli, gi bleeding, constipation, gastroparesis. I've had erosive esophagitis. Bad gerd. Amenorrhea. Abdominal pain. Only lost 30 pounds all year so it can't be that bad.\n\n My esophagus was tore up. And c diff almost killed me. So I quit purging after ecoli and c diff at the same time. I had a serious wake up call. I became so ill and feared for my life and it sort of woke me up like I need to take care of myself better.\n\nbut I would have instances where I threw up blood. My voice went away. I had to swallow lidocaine to help numb the pain. Like I wasn't well. I had to get an endoscopy and they said no more ibuprofen because it would continue to get worse.\n\nAnd the purging wasn't like consistent it only was like sometimes. Mainly it's the restriction for me especially now. I haven't purged in over a year. I threw up so much blood and it scares me. And the way the teeth are being rotted from behind them like my two front teeth are eroded on the back side. \n\nMy heart doesn't wanna let me exercise but the extreme fasting and eating fewer calories than I need is what makes me think I have a problem. The way I'm obsessed withy body. Pics. Comparison. The mirror. Checking how clothes fit. Yeah. My pulse going crazy whenever I stand up or move. I get chest pains. \n\nBut I realized like a bunch of the things I feel could be related.\n\nMy body temp is always like 96-97. My heart doesn't typically get low like some people. It never goes below 55. But it frequently gets to 170-180 when I'm up on my feet. Idk. Even my thyroid was a little off like I used to have hypothyroidism but it went slightly hyper but I didn't think it was serious enough for treatment and I thought treatment might make me fatter.\n\nBut the video called me out. it made me realize that just because I have a fat disorder and I'm not underweight doesn't make this a healthy lifestyle. I need to talk to a professional. Admit that this is an issue I'm struggling with. And like get help for myself.\n\nI can tell I've lost a lot of muscle and I'm curious what my bones are like. My like vitamin D3 is low but that's cuz I'm from MN and a vampire. And I'm scared nobody will believe me that I could have an eating disorder and still be so big. The little voice tells me I just need to wait a little longer and keep fasting.

Like I just thought I was crazy. If my diet was unsafe then I'd probably be losing more weight. And that kept me in denial.\n\nMy diagnoses sort of kicked up my ED behaviors but at the same time it made me admit I do actually have a problem and it's not just in my head. I have been dealing with many of the effects of having an eating disorder but I'm in denial because my BMI is over 40 and like nobody would ever believe me if I told them.\n\n I'm afraid to say hey guys I have ___ because I don't fit the mold and I'm not skinny what so ever. And there were times I did get better. I was in an institution where they fed me lots of calories and when I got sober at first I ate a lot for like 5 months. I got to my highest weight ever and I was just like omg I am out of control.\n\nSo I started \"dieting\" again but it quickly turned into a game like the calorie goal kept getting lower. \n\nWhen I was in my early 20s I starved myself for a year and got to my lowest adult weight. But any time I ate normal I would start gaining weight. And I had issues where I'd eat what I decided was too much. So I did used to purge. And make myself burn more calories. I always fidget and rock and move. I used to do cardio but something changed and I can't anymore.\n\nSo this time around I knew I had to lose weight somehow. So I decided to try dieting again even though I feared things going back to how they were before\n I knew there were times when I was unhealthier but I couldn't really identify why it was.\n\nBut it quickly turned from a diet into something worse again. That little voice that told me to stop eating and starve my body from calories so I wouldn't gain. So I could try and lose. But it never worked. That stupid little voice. I have a mirror facing my bed so everytime I get up and out I can look at myself and remember why I don't wanna eat too much. And I get so starving I have to eat and then I tell myself it's bad food and feel guilty.\n\nI decided to do intermittent fasting sinve so many recommend it. So I started with 16/8. But it turned into 24 X3 days a week. Then 5. Over time the fasting got longer. I didn't lose like a lot of weight though. I tried very hard to only lose 30 pounds in a year. I restricted more than what is recommended and according to my bmr and bmi I should have been losing at least 2 pounds a week or more even if I rate 1300 calories. So I'd aim for 0 and then allow myself 300-500 for my omad if it was an eating day.\n\n I mean on a bad day I'd eat over 1,000 calories and feel so guilty. But a good day I wouldn't eat food at all. And eventually it was two days. Then l let myself eat food because you do need it to survive they say and I'm sure it's worse to starve harder. I don't have the willpower to starve longer than 48 hours. But for some reason that's just not what happened. And it could be the whole starvation mode thing or that eating disorders won't actually help me lose weight. \n\nBut a little voice tells me I don't deserve a normal amount of food. I'm not skinny enough to get help. And I never will be. But a coach on YouTube made a video that was my wake up on call. I have so many side effects from this. \n\nIn the past years I've been to the er for c diff, ecoli, gi bleeding, constipation, gastroparesis. I've had erosive esophagitis. Bad gerd. Amenorrhea. Abdominal pain. Only lost 30 pounds all year so it can't be that bad.\n\n My esophagus was tore up. And c diff almost killed me. So I quit purging after ecoli and c diff at the same time. I had a serious wake up call. I became so ill and feared for my life and it sort of woke me up like I need to take care of myself better.\n\nbut I would have instances where I threw up blood. My voice went away. I had to swallow lidocaine to help numb the pain. Like I wasn't well. I had to get an endoscopy and they said no more ibuprofen because it would continue to get worse.\n\nAnd the purging wasn't like consistent it only was like sometimes. Mainly it's the restriction for me especially now. I haven't purged in over a year. I threw up so much blood and it scares me. And the way the teeth are being rotted from behind them like my two front teeth are eroded on the back side. \n\nMy heart doesn't wanna let me exercise but the extreme fasting and eating fewer calories than I need is what makes me think I have a problem. The way I'm obsessed withy body. Pics. Comparison. The mirror. Checking how clothes fit. Yeah. My pulse going crazy whenever I stand up or move. I get chest pains. \n\nBut I realized like a bunch of the things I feel could be related.\n\nMy body temp is always like 96-97. My heart doesn't typically get low like some people. It never goes below 55. But it frequently gets to 170-180 when I'm up on my feet. Idk. Even my thyroid was a little off like I used to have hypothyroidism but it went slightly hyper but I didn't think it was serious enough for treatment and I thought treatment might make me fatter.\n\nBut the video called me out. it made me realize that just because I have a fat disorder and I'm not underweight doesn't make this a healthy lifestyle. I need to talk to a professional. Admit that this is an issue I'm struggling with. And like get help for myself.\n\nI can tell I've lost a lot of muscle and I'm curious what my bones are like. My like vitamin D3 is low but that's cuz I'm from MN and a vampire. And I'm scared nobody will believe me that I could have an eating disorder and still be so big. The little voice tells me I just need to wait a little longer and keep fasting. It says I have plenty of fat to burn and this is fine because I'm huge and if I were doing it right I wouldn't be this big.", "send_replies": true, "spoiler": false, "stickied": false, "subreddit": "eatingdisorder", "subreddit_id": "t5_2hcvml", "subreddit_subscribers": 1520, "subreddit_type": "public", "thumbnail": "nsfw", "title": "Lipedema, a fat and connective tissue disorder, and eating disorder.", "total_awards_received": 0, "treatment_tags": [], "upvote_ratio": 1.0, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/eatingdisorder/comments/recmz3/lipedema_a_fat_and_connective_tissue_disorder_and/"}, {"all_awardings": [], "allow_live_comments": false, "author": "DriveZannie", "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_flair_text": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "author_fullname": "t2_cgbqpi50", "author_is_blocked": false, "author_patreon_flair": false, "author_premium": false, "awarders": [], "can_mod_post": false, "contest_mode": false, "created_utc": 1639301775, "domain": "self.eatingdisorder", "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/eatingdisorder/comments/relnd2/just_feeling_really_bummed/", "gildings": {}, "id": "relnd2", "is_created_from_ads_ui": false, "is_crosspostable": true, "is_meta": false, "is_original_content": false, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "is_robot_indexable": true, "is_self": true, "is_video": false, "link_flair_background_color": "#7193ff", "link_flair_richtext": [], "link_flair_template_id": "ffb84e50-005b-11ec-802d-120ecd2b0b4a", "link_flair_text": "Encouragement \ud83d\udc9c", "link_flair_text_color": "dark", "link_flair_type": "text", "locked": false, "media_only": false, "no_follow": true, "num_comments": 0, "num_crossposts": 0, "over_18": true, "permalink": "/r/eatingdisorder/comments/relnd2/just_feeling_really_bummed/", "pinned": false, "retrieved_on": 1639301785, "score": 1, "selftext": "Today I went out with my aunt and we ate kraftwich for lunch.

was doing really well I barely thought about food when I ate and I didn't feel the usual guild or need to \"make up for it \" then I noticed for the past 3 weeks  I started avoiding food not intentional at first but if I'm being honest the last 4 days I'll stop half way through whatever I'm eating or make up a reason not to eat at all partially intentionally and because I have dropped a large amount of wait in this time I didn't notice at first but when people started to point it out I weighed myself (witch I try to never do because one I do its pretty much an automatic relapse trigger for me ) and they where right I had .my problem is befor when I my eating disorder was very different all I thought about was the number I would count everything obsessively and keep track it's all I thought about but this isn't the case now I'm not counting calories or trying to stay under intentionally I'm just avoiding food ( I think it's because it just makes me feel better but it

i think it stemmed from witnessing my mom being body shamed for her body and just this obsession my mum's family had around weight. i also drank a lot of green tea and never drank soft drinks but it was still never to the point that i felt hatred towards my body or didn't feel good enough bcos I'm skinny and was always mostly validated for my body. \n\ni then (possibly cos of body positivity culture on social media) stopped restricting myself and started wanting to gain weight since I was on the underweight side cos of my anemia as well as from being born underweight.\n\n\ncoming to now,  just got off a narcissistic emotionally abusive relationship(been close to 3months) which was also my first relationship and it left me heartbroken and with a loss of appetite which has now gotten better but\na close friend of mine, who's very into fitness, does intermittent fasting and would talk to me about it and it's benefits which i was always reluctant about but ever since my breakup I've been using it as a way to justify starving myself and also obsessing over my body. wanting a flat stomach and just obsessing over skinny models online. wanting to be smaller. even when I'm awake and could be eating and clearly empty stomached, i still go hours without eating. i guess the breakup has affected my self esteem even tho my body was never an insecurity in the relationship ever. i guess I'm obsessing over my physical image to cope?\n\ni also have depression and ptsd(since 15 years old) that makes me sleep a lot and lately has been making me neglect eating or even hydrating myself which i was always good at. \n\ni also have had fights with my mum which would lead to me not eating the entire day out of spite even though the only one it's truly affecting is me.\n\n\n\nsorry if this is all over the place.", "send_replies": true, "spoiler": false, "stickied": false, "subreddit": "eatingdisorder", "subreddit_id": "t5_2hcvml", "subreddit_subscribers": 1560, "subreddit_type": "public", "thumbnail": "nsfw", "title": "do i have an ed?", "total_awards_received": 0, "treatment_tags": [], "upvote_ratio": 1.0, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/eatingdisorder/comments/rq78xx/do_i_have_an_ed/"}, {"all_awardings": [], "allow_live_comments": false, "author": "Klorainne", "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_flair_text": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "author_fullname": "t2_ecwmgsyh", "author_is_blocked": false, "author_patreon_flair": false, "author_premium": false, "awarders": [], "can_mod_post": false, "contest_mode": false, "created_utc": 1640718185, "domain": "self.eatingdisorder", "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/eatingdisorder/comments/rqmzsr/warning_signs/", "gildings": {}, "id": "rqmzsr", "is_created_from_ads_ui": false, "is_crosspostable": true, "is_meta": false, "is_original_content": false, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "is_robot_indexable": true, "is_self": true, "is_video": false, "link_flair_background_color": "", "link_flair_richtext": [], "link_flair_text_color": "dark", "link_flair_type": "text", "locked": false, "media_only": false, "no_follow": true, "num_comments": 0, "num_crossposts": 0, "over_18": true, "permalink": "/r/eatingdisorder/comments/rqmzsr/warning_signs/", "pinned": false, "retrieved_on": 1640718196, "score": 1, "selftext": "Hi I was just wondering if anyone would be comfortable enough to share maybe their warning signs that they were starting to get an eating disorder?
