So I do have trust issues and things hurt me easily.

I've been upfront since the beginning about who I am... I'm not someone who just sleeps around.. my emotional state of mind can't handle that....he always tells me he's the same and doesn't sleep around... \n\nWell it's been over a week and he hasn't bothered to reach out to me. Last time this happened he was sick and stuck in bed... well now I decided to reach out to him yesterday because it's truly frustrating me that he's gone radio silent...\n\nI know I shouldn't let it happen but it really hurts me because I like him. And I let my walls down for him.... I Don't know, maybe I'm over reacting and it's completely fine... but jeez, if you're not interested in me can you tell me because I can't handle this anxiety or feeling this way. I go to this dark place because this is exactly what would happen when my ex was cheating, he'd go radio silent on me.... so it really brings me to tears feeling this way. Ugh.

I almost ran out of the gym crying while playing volleyball even though nothing happened (should show how anxious I can be sometimes).

I made some adjustments to diet and started getting my energy back. \n\nAround that time, I started feeling heat sensations in my leg. My doc quickly stated it was most likely just Piriformis and referred me to PT. I started getting bad cramps as well in my calf and outer thigh. \nEventually, I started getting crazy hot flashes at night that sent burning pain down the sides of my arms and kept me up all night. It felt like icy hot. \n\nEventually it happened very lightly during the day. The pain was not as intense, but now my left arm was taking longer to recover. \n\nNow, it's bad. And it's spreading to my right arm. My left hand fingers are stiff and tingle and move slower. My shoulder muscles both burn and cramp like someone just stuck a needle in them. My forearm cramps. My right hand thumb is beginning to stiffen and feel weak and tingle. \n\nNow my right leg is starting to twitch a bunch. I'm crying almost constantly because my anxiety is really making me think I'm GOING to die. Or become an invalid. I'm so so so so scared today.

I was fed up with it. I fought with him and went home and I just feel so conflicted, anxious and depressed.  \n\nWhat he did was that the night before, he was very drunk and FaceTiming me. He was with his friend at home but he was really intoxicated and he was crying a lot and was asking me to come over and be there for him (ps he has a lot of mental issues), and when I told him I was annoyed and tired, said goodnight and went to sleep, he called some more and sent messages to talk to me which I didn\u2019t answer cause I was sleeping, so then the final message he sent was him calling me a \u201cwhore\u201d..\n\nI didn\u2019t even see that particular message until I went over last night and he started crying and apologizing for that message he sent the night before, and I was confused because I hadn\u2019t even seen that yet (because it was on a social media I didn\u2019t check and he was messaging me on a few different ones) and then I checked it and saw it in front of him. He kept insisting he was blacked out and thinks it wasn\u2019t even the alcohol and that he must\u2019ve took something. His friend also confirmed that he was blacked out and acting crazy too. I fought with him obviously after seeing the message and said horrible things to him to get back at him. Him blacking out doesn\u2019t excuse what he sent out of now where for no reason and especially considering it\u2019s happened a few time before in the past.. he\u2019s sent me messages a few other times throughout the relationship when he was drunk and called me a whore and accuse me of cheating and stuff. I\u2019ve just had enough. \n\nAll I want is to go see him but I feel like it\u2019s stupid of me to do that and go back to him. I\u2019m not sure what to do and I also feel isolated and lonely cause I haven\u2019t really talked to my friends in the past week and my boyfriend is who I\u2019ve been seeing and closest to at the moment.. I\u2019ve never had trouble talking about anything with my friends but in this situation particularly, I don\u2019t want to talk to my best friends about it because ever since the last fight I had with him, they don\u2019t support me going back to him and I haven\u2019t told them that I have even though I\u2019m pretty sure they know, and I haven\u2019t really talked to them in the past week. \n\nSo on top of that anytime there\u2019s these big conflicts with my boyfriend and I withdraw and don\u2019t speak to him, I just feel even more terrible and conflicted and I get a lot of depressed and anxious than normal.

I've been in and out of institutions including psych wards, rehabs, boys homes and jails. I've cleaned my life up after a 18 month rehab program and I'm coming up to 3 years sobriety.\n\nI've achieved so much with my addiction but I have made no progress with my mental health. For example I've been of my medication for around 2 years now I was prescribed Seroquel (300mg), Zyprexa(20mg) and Avanza (45mg)and everything had been fine. COVID19 really put a spanner on the works and the lockdowns have had a massive effect on my symptoms, I can barely leave the house now without jumping into a massive panic attack and pre thinking situations before they happen. \n\nI'm not going to go into fill detail about the paranoid thoughts I have and the level of panic i reach as it's very personal to me.. let's just say it is a massive burden and is putting an even bigger hold on my life. I cannot communicate the way I used to, I can't form any new friendships as all my IRLs are still on drugs or in jail, I've tried getting into 4 different online courses and can't learn over the internet.\n\nI have little to no interests or hobbies I like doing, my whole thought process about everything on the world is negative and very black and white. \n\nI do not want to go back on medication as the side effects outweigh the pros, the lack of sex drive, issues with erections, weight gain, loss of personality, loss of imagination and all the other great things of life. \n\nI feel like I'm rambling on way to much but basically I'm looking for really niche and preferably work from home jobs that I could look put for so I can get myself back into the real life and not living off the government.\n\nI should not that no resume has been inactive for 6-7 years so that leaves a massive gap, I can't pass a police check due to a massive criminal record with violent and serious crimes.\n\nNothing has worked out for me and every job trial or opportunity I find I end up having a paranoid episode or panic attack, this is why I'm looming for something from home.\n\nI've tried customer service, tele sales, appointment setter and all the other common stuff like that. Most jobs either don't want me because of the record or the holes on my resume.. or I don't want the job because its dodgy and cold calling fund-raising.\n\nI'm hoping to find some cool niche jobs that after for such a mess like myself!

I\u2019ve been struggling with GAD, as long as I can remember and Panic disorder for a year. \n\nI\u2019ve tried Celexa (40mg), which didn\u2019t really have any affect on me so I switched to Zoloft (100mg) which was helping with negative thoughts and panic attacks but I started feeling a bit emotionless, maybe it was too high a dosage? So i stopped taking that and I was on nothing for a couple of months. I still had anxiety and the occasional panic attack build up. Then life happened. \n\nMy grandpa passed away and I was a mess, I had several panic attacks that made me late to the funeral. I just cried the whole funeral but I felt like I let go. But my family had him flown back to his hometown in Mexico where we saw his funeral service through Facetime, I had to miss the burial because of work. And my family planned a 9day mourning service (it is still happening but i have missed the past 7days) And we had to put our family dog down and found out my SO\u2019s old mentor passed away too.\n\nIn the middle of all this going on, I felt like it was time to go back on medication and wanted to try something else, and i was hopeful. My dr seemed like she cared a lot and prescribed me amitriptyline (10mg) for anxiety and propranolol (10mg as needed) for panic attacks. (Metformin(500mg) on top of that) I was fine and hopeful for a week.\n\nThen one night I had the most terrible panic attack with the most terrible negative thoughts and intrusive thoughts and this deep feeling of hopelessness and feeling like I was going to die and I just felt so lonely despite having my SO there with me holding me and trying to comfort me. This panic attack lasted 4 days, peaking that first night. The rest of the days, i had the nonstop numbness/tingling/cold feeling in my body and back of my head. I had multiple crying spells and the hopelessness never stopped. I only found relief when i was asleep. I also lost all my appetite during this time. I still don\u2019t get hungry, if i let myself, i would not eat anything all day and not even feel any hunger, which is scary because I LOVE food and I LOVE to eat.\n\nI was never able to reach my PCP and i felt so desperate for escape or relief i almost ended up in the er or urgent care. I ended up reaching out to a dr online and she was like a safety net for me and i saw her multiple times before i could see a psychiatrist. I wasn\u2019t feeling much better and I kept having crying spells and cried while talking to her. She ended up prescribing me buspirone (5mg 2/day) to help calm me down. It\u2019s been helping a bit but the negative thoughts are still there and I can\u2019t escape them and have resulted to mind numbing with Netflix until I could see the psychiatrist. (I\u2019m also seeing a therapist but i just started with her and we\u2019re working on CBT)\n\nI was feeling the smallest bit of hope today when I had my appt with the psychiatrist. I told her everything that\u2019s happened and she told me she didn\u2019t think it was all the meds I was on that I felt caused that severe 4day panic attack, despite never having anything like that before or ever having these severe amount of negative thoughts before. It made me feel like one of my deepest fears was right, I\u2019m just broken, it\u2019s just me. Part of me still thinks it\u2019s the medications and now I\u2019m terrified of trying anything. She told me I\u2019m having physical sensations because i don\u2019t have enough oxygen. I\u2019ve been trying breathing exercises and meditation during this whole time so i just felt like she wasn\u2019t hearing how intense everything was for me and i kept choking up multiple times when i explained everything.\n\nI asked about going back on sertraline because it\u2019s what I\u2019m familiar with but she was hesitant because she said I was specifying it for anxiety but i just want the negative thinking to stop. She asked if i had depression and i didn\u2019t know how to answer because i don\u2019t know if i do, i thought she would have been able to figure out if i did during the appt. I told her I wasn\u2019t sure but the past week+ has felt like it. So she told me to start sertraline at 25mg while still on buspirone. She said she didn\u2019t think it would cause severe side effects but I know it\u2019s always an unknown with medication.\n\nI know meds take a while to kick in but I just felt so helpless talking to her and hearing what she had to say. And there wasn\u2019t a lot of reassurance there, i know that meds are tricky but i was hoping to feel lighter afterwards. And her reiterating how long everything would take to really kick in made me feel like I was pushed back into the black hole I felt I was slowly climbing out of. I ended up crying afterwards because of how hopeless i felt and I had crying spells all day after. Idk if it\u2019s the state of mind I\u2019ve been in that made me react this way or if it\u2019s even the \u201cright\u201d reaction to what she said.\n\nI ended up looking up buspirone + sertraline on reddit and i saw many people say good things, which gave me a bit of hope, but I\u2019m just extremely terrified, i don\u2019t know how much more i can handle.\n\nThanks for sticking through this all, any words of kindness or assurance would be well needed and welcome. \n\nFor everyone else feeling similarly, you\u2019re not alone, i know it\u2019s hard to be positive but it helps a bit to know it\u2019s not just you.", "send_replies": true, "spoiler": false, "stickied": false, "subreddit": "Anxiety", "subreddit_id": "t5_2qmij", "subreddit_subscribers": 502772, "subreddit_type":

I had gone through a very stressful period of my life in the first 2 weeks of November. I even had panic attacks for 3 or 4 days. I also began seeing spots in my vision and flashes of light. This scared me, so I got my eyes checked through a dilated eye exam- my eyes were alright. Basically my flashes are streaks of light that come from boundaries of surfaces and dark surfaces. Example- if a book is kept on the table, then I see phosphenes from the edges for a second or so. These flashes usually come from only bright surfaces, but now seem to be coming from every other object. Also in the dark or on very bright surfaces I can see white spots (slightly bigger than dots) flashing around that have some bluish or yellowish or greenish boundary (just like the ones that we see on closing our eyes). Then I googled about it and read about visual snow. The thing is I just see mild static which occasionally increases due to stressful situations, but I don't have anything like floaters, palinopsia, etc. When I spent time with my friends for a couple of days my visual disturbances decreased a bit, but now it's again the same.

My anxiety soared after this, I felt very depressed, while all this was going on WINTER started. I hate winter, for me winter is very depressing and gloomy, with low sunlight and all. I had only 20 days to mid-terms and I was very scared. But I just couldn't study. And what happened was that I wasted all my time. I had no prep days left now. 1 day to the first exam. I mustered all the strength I had and got studying. The three subjects I scored good in were a breeze but the big behemoths still stood. I had 3 days of prep leave for Maths and 5 days for Accounts. I studied relentlessly straight on all the prep leaves and I am happy to announce that I have scored very well on all 5 subjects. What I want to convey to you reading this is that Remember always in life no matter how much time you have wasted, no matter where you are right now, even though you may feel that you are at a point from where you cannot return or you think that you don't have time to achieve what you want, YOU ARE WRONG, you can do anything because it is never too late to do the right thing. Life has a weird and paradoxical way of working, when you start to do the right thing and conquer your fears, life magically gives you back the time you wasted and all the rewards you missed. So whatever you are fearing in life right now is nothing. At whatever deadline you are, START NOW and you will see that it will reap benefits and everything you wished for. Now go and conquer the world. :)", "send_replies": true, "spoiler": false, "stickied": false, "subreddit": "Anxiety", "subreddit_id": "t5_2qmij", "subreddit_subscribers": 502776, "subreddit_type": "public", "thumbnail": "self", "title": "It's Never Too Late", "total_awards_received": 0, "treatment_tags": [], "upvote_ratio": 1.0, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/Anxiety/comments/r70ui7/its_never_too_late/", "whitelist_status": "no_ads", "wls": 0}, {"all_awardings": [], "allow_live_comments": false, "author": "tomatoesmama", "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_flair_text": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "author_fullname": "t2_9jaa89p7", "author_is_blocked": false, "author_patreon_flair": false, "author_premium": false, "awarders": [], "can_mod_post": false, "contest_mode": false, "created_utc": 1638426853, "domain": "self.Anxiety", "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/Anxiety/comments/r711cw/too_many_things_going_on/", "gildings": {}, "id": "r711cw", "is_created_from_ads_ui": false, "is_crosspostable": true, "is_meta": false, "is_original_content": false, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "is_robot_indexable": true, "is_self": true, "is_video": false, "link_flair_background_color": "#0079d3", "link_flair_css_class": "venting", "link_flair_richtext": [], "link_flair_template_id": "19ddd408-76a1-11e5-acb1-0ea7f7edc7ed", "link_flair_text": "Venting", "link_flair_text_color": "light", "link_flair_type": "text", "locked": false, "media_only": false, "no_follow": true, "num_comments": 1, "num_crossposts": 0, "over_18": false, "parent_whitelist_status": "no_ads", "permalink": "/r/Anxiety/comments/r711cw/too_many_things_going_on/", "pinned": false, "pwls": 0, "retrieved_on": 1638426863, "score": 1, "selftext": "Well, I\u2019m in my mid 20\u2019s and have been a failure most of my life.

dealing with anxiety for some time now. It mainly manifests in sweating, high heart rate &amp; shaky hands/voice and headaches. Mentally, i can feel completely chill yet my body is freaking out.\n\nI quit caffeine completely and stopped smoking which both helped a little.\n\nFirst medication i tried were SSRI (paxil, then citalopram and then prozac) but they didn\u2019t seem to help much other than making me feel \u2018numb\u2019 (little thoughts, kind of a grey mood 24/7). I didn\u2019t like any of them and i quit. \n\nHowever, the physical effects from anxiety are pretty intense and im looking for a way to reduce them. \n\nI read stories about beta blockers (mainly propranolol though) being effective at combating the physical sensations. My doctor suggested bisoprolol. \n\nHas anyone here tried this medication? How did it make you feel (the good &amp; the bad).

I think I have this constant complex that I'm everyone's last choice for a friend, and that I'm more of a burden, if anything, and I also catastrophize extremely often (such as: my friend didn't respond as quickly as normal to my text, I said something to offend them and they're texting their other, more liked friend about how much they hate me). There's other things too, but I think I can say with some confidence that it's generally taken a toll on my self esteem, and that it's made me miserable pretty often.\n\nEarlier today I was talking to friends about anxiety symptoms, as there was a poster about them in our classroom, and I was mentioning how blushing and getting embarrassed could be a symptom to one of my friends. My other friend then mentioned that it wasn't all social anxiety was, and that she knew someone who had panic attacks if there were too many people in a room. I know it wasn't her intention, but I took that as her rightfully invalidating anything I'd been telling myself up to that point. I've never gotten a panic attack, and I had been trying to validate that I might have some issues, but now I'm fixiating on how my problems aren't even that bad and I had to have been faking because other people have it worse. It's not even like I have anything wrong with my life, so I can't shake off the feeling that I just want to be \"special\" in some way. \n\nI guess I'm looking for advice, and if anyone else has felt this way, really, anything would be appreciated.", "send_replies": true, "spoiler": false, "stickied": false, "subreddit": "Anxiety", "subreddit_id": "t5_2qmij", "subreddit_subscribers": 502806,
