On top of the meds I now have to take for my weak heart, Drs stress that I avoid stress as it will raise my pressure and heart rate. I had to leave my job due to this condition,  social security is taking their sweet time and I am now broke and still have bills and my kids to take care of. \\n     Does anyone have some natural ways I can try and manage the stress of all of this without doing more/worse damage to my heart. I am literally sleeping maybe 2 hours a night and I have tried meditation, ASMR etc etc. Nothing is helping at all. I need to de stress! \\n     Thank you for listening!   \n",
