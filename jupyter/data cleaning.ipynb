      "Link to the original video : https:wwwyoutubecomwatch?v=7r-M1gzKDb8Here are five tips to help you reduce your holiday anxiety Number 1 Dont invite people known to cause trouble at your holiday gatheringIf you have someone on your holiday guest list who is known to cause trouble For example, starts fights, shows up high, or insists on talking about politics or other difficult topics dont invite them to your gathering Attending holiday gatherings is a privilege Do whats right for you by not inviting discord into your event The same is true for events you are invited You do not need to go to a party or event that makes you uncomfortableNumber 2 Create a budget and stick to it!Money, or the lack of it, is a major source of stress during the holiday season Whether its purchasing gifts or spending on decorations and parties, the holidays can get expensive Set a budget and stick to it Avoid impulse shopping Theres no need to tempt yourself by browsing items you dont have the funds to buy No matter how you choose to budget for the holidays, setting a budget and sticking to it will reduce your holiday stress levelsNumber 3 Simplify!Another source of stress during the holidays is doing too much If you need a vacation from your vacation, it isnt much of a rest period Do you really have to do everything on your list? Do you decorate every room in the house because you want to? or because others believe you should If it brings you joy to decorate every room in the house, by all means do it But if you are doing tasks out of expectation, consider downsizingNumber 4 Remember the Reason for the Season!Your stress may decrease if you keep focused on why we do what we do at this time of year Perhaps you are a religious person who connects with your holidays as a time of awe or renewal You may be more secular and experience this as a time to be with family and friends For some, this may be a time of year that reminds you of difficult experiences, so you may need to reach out and find new positive meaning for the season Whatever your beliefs, focus on whats important to you, rather than tasks and being busy Doing activities that have meaning will help reduce your anxiety…And number 5 Practice gratitudePerhaps most important, the holiday season provides an opportunity to spend time thinking about all that we have to be grateful for family, friends, meaningful work, and more When we are able to see what we have, rather than fixate on what we dont, some of our anxiety will give way to love, grace, and hope\n",

      "Hey guys, so I have a puzzling one for you How common are stress hives? I am asking because I recently had what I thought was an allergic reaction to something at work I broke out in hives and had some swellingAnyhow that cleared up and went away, or so I thought Just this morning I woke up with a small outbreak of hives on my forehead and a swollen left eye to the point where I splashed water on my face to open the eye a little more (thought it was eye crusties)Anyhow, I am keen to think maybe my body now might react to stress due to hives as I was meant to take the GRE today (the reason I didn't is one of the most bizarre things, but that's for another day) and I'm curious if my body decided to think this heightened level of stress was something that could've harmed me so tried to flare up with hives\n",

      "This is the continued story of my previous post titled the same as this title Anyways, I am trying to get involved in a deep brain stimulation clinical trial since my depression is some of the most extreme anyone can suffer with I dont find joy in anything at all, nothing is interesting, pleasurable, enjoyable, or fun Colors look dull and lifeless, my pain tolerance is very high, my memory is some of the worst out there, its progressively gotten worse, my cognition is complete shit, I cant concentrate very well, my attention span is awful, food doesnt taste special or “tasty”, scents dont really make me happy or satisfied, nothing really smells all that good, clothes dont feel comfy and warm, blankets dont make me feel snug and cozy, my appetite is terrible and Im losing weight fast, Im not thirsty at all, doing simple things like cleaning and hygiene feel like a total hassle Music doesnt sound melodic or addictive, I dont see beauty in anything, I dont care about my well being or others well being, nothing has inherent meaning to me, I have an awful despondent look on my face all the time I cant laugh naturally, I cant smile naturally, I really have no expressions on my face The worst symptom is time passing by, im not sure why thats a symptom, it just started showing up in the psych hospital, and its extremely aggravating The simple concept of time passing just pisses me off, I dont know why, it just does for some reason This makes life much more unbearable, as time is constantly happening, time never stops, and so my brain is in a constant state of distress Money means nothing to me I cant work, I cant drive, I cant go to college, I cant hang out with friends like I used to Im very dilated to myself One of the exclusion criteria for this clinical trial is a suicide attempt in the last 2 years This is distressing me on a whole new level This exclusion criteria makes no sense to me, as very severe depression usually coincides with suicide intent or attempts Suicidal thoughts are not exclusion criteria though I am trying to get in contact with the team and get a consultation interview for the trial I think I definitely should get a chance, as my symptoms are pretty extreme What do you guys think? Let me know your input in the comments please\n",

Ive also never been on antidepressants before so is there anything I should know? Should I stop smoking weed while on antidepressants?

Why should I have to keep going and become the crazy cat lady 20 years from now? Why is it wrong for me to put myself out of my misery before any of that shit happens? Ive seen these people, theyre 40+ years old and theyre just losers You can tell they arent where they want to be in life and that they dont believe they ever will People always say “You cant give up, it gets better! Just keep trying!” Like no, you dont know that it gets better It cant get better for everyone If theres winners then there has to be losers as well I dont see whats so wrong about throwing in the towel when you know youve lost I shouldnt have to continue on with my pathetic existence, being nothing but an embarrassment to myself and my family I shouldnt have to become a lonely middle aged woman who gets pitied by everyone they meet I shouldnt have to be the person who kills themself and then doesnt get discovered for weeks because literally no one talks to them or cares that they exist I should be allowed to end it when I no longer believe its possible to turn things around, and who would know when that is better than myself?

I requested they do a evaluation of my mental health\n",
      "So I got some pretty heavy shit going on in life  The kind of shit that is going to be very difficult for the next several months and very possibly years  (As I typed that it felt like I'm talking about prison and it's nothing like that)  Now, I'm surprised at how well I've been handling everything over the last couple months but these last few days have been almost unbearable   Eveningnight time is the worst as I'm settling in the house  I have time to think  I have time to realize how terrible almost every little thing is and I can't see any positives  I stay sick to my stomach and start randomly tearing up almost crying  Sometimes a ful cry ngl  I try to get a good workout everyday because it helps me feel better and today I couldn't even make it through that  I'm so mentally drained I can't focusWhat should I do to make these nights better?  I won't drink because I know it'll get worse and I've been down that road  I wanted to take a handful of melatonin and just sleep till tomorrow (it's only 7 now), but I read it can alter mood as a side effect  Advice would help me not want to just give up  Thanks\n",

      "Its getting to the time of year where Im sad most days again, doctors say “winter depression” but the only month Im genuinely able to be happy is always September, and I dont really like September to be honestNormally I deal with Suicidal thoughts during days but lately Ive been having dreams nightmaresThe first, my friend was dead, so I shot my self (If I remember correctly)The second, I failed a test, slit my wrists then my throat and bleed outThe third, I had a mental breakdown cut 3 inches of my hair off, took a shower, when to sleep, woke up, realized I cut my hair and went and hung myself on a tree, (more of a guess of the end, as I grabbed a rope and went into the forest so…lol)There were a couple more related, but they were mostly about cutting, bashing my hard on a wall etc and not the actual death part, but most felt like they ended that way“Minor inconveniences” in brackets because to me they are no I have a huge fear of failure, and my hair being cut, but I dont know what the suicidal aspect was for…like wtf brain Mostly a rant, so thank you for listening ♥️\n",
      "Have you ever noticed that in the news, it seems like with all of these events there is this lack of empathy or sensitivity Coronavirus was politicized and it made people go at each other's throats, school shootings, cars ramming into parades, lots of violence, politicians participating in name calling and shouting matches For a person with depression, this can really weigh down on you Why does it seem like there is this lack of sensitivity especially in an age of political correctness, inclusive culture, and a need to acknowledge the plight of certain groups (social justice)? I thought society was going to become more inclusive because I grew up in school being told all of this But the truth is, we are divided now more than ever before Everything is now politics this politics that And it seems like people really don't care about making the world better for other people It just seems like we are playing a game of social darwinism Maybe I am too idealistic?\n",
      "I can't help but feel hopeless most of the time I love the thought of having friends, having someone to love and a fun and exciting life But to have those things you need energyAnd hope And trust I have none of those things so therefore I have have none of the things I dream of It's a vicious cycle and I suppose that's what life is I tend to get into a depressive episode but I always come to the realization that I don't need friendsOr someone to love, mostly because I only have the energy to take care of me and worry about me Maybe one day I'll feel like trying to keep a relationship with someone But for right now I'm gonna focus on me, right now, where I'm at One day at a time If you don't have hope today maybe you will tomorrow God can take away a life in a split second but He can also improve a life in a split second I'm hopeless but I'm hoping\n",

      "Im 18 and graduated last summer Ive had depression since middle school, and Ive been to therapy and everything, but my view on life has been on a near constant declineIm the most average person Ive ever met Im just “okay” at everything I try, which is better than being awful at everything, so I know I have no right to complain, but I just feel so…pointless? My childhood was fun My dad left when I was 11 and after that we didnt have much extra money for travelling or anything extravagant, but again, I had fun, and my mothers side of the family was always good to me I had a group of friends I was close to as well But since I graduated, my friends have been branching out, and Ive had nobody to share my feelings with My family lives very simply and they believe sustenance and shelter is enough for a happy life I respect that and wish I felt that same, but I feel like Im just fading into obscurity without meaning, while all the people I know find excitement in their new adult life Ive tried making new friends, but now they just never last Many people I meet call me plain or boring I have interests, like camping, reading sci-fi, art, video games, etc But Im just never, ever enough I left university recently because I dont see a point to pushing on anymore It seems theres always someone who is better for any situation, academically, socially or otherwise I got a new job after leaving uni, and a coworker near my age I speak with outside of work (more often than I ever suspected could ever happen with me) has begun to tell me they wish I was more interesting I just want a friend that doesnt think of me this way The same coworker told me that they had a rough childhood, got kicked out at 15 by an abusive parent and everything I have nothing to complain about it comparison, but my life feels so damn bleak Why should someone with such little influence or meaning to anyone go on?

I've suffered from severe anxiety and paranoia since I was about 14, I'm now 26 I've been in and out of institutions including psych wards, rehabs, boys homes and jails I've cleaned my life up after a 18 month rehab program and I'm coming up to 3 years sobrietyI've achieved so much with my addiction but I have made no progress with my mental health For example I've been of my medication for around 2 years now I was prescribed Seroquel (300mg), Zyprexa(20mg) and Avanza (45mg)and everything had been fine COVID19 really put a spanner on the works and the lockdowns have had a massive effect on my symptoms, I can barely leave the house now without jumping into a massive panic attack and pre thinking situations before they happen I'm not going to go into fill detail about the paranoid thoughts I have and the level of panic i reach as it's very personal to me let's just say it is a massive burden and is putting an even bigger hold on my life I cannot communicate the way I used to, I can't form any new friendships as all my IRLs are still on drugs or in jail, I've tried getting into 4 different online courses and can't learn over the internetI have little to no interests or hobbies I like doing, my whole thought process about everything on the world is negative and very black and white I do not want to go back on medication as the side effects outweigh the pros, the lack of sex drive, issues with erections, weight gain, loss of personality, loss of imagination and all the other great things of life I feel like I'm rambling on way to much but basically I'm looking for really niche and preferably work from home jobs that I could look put for so I can get myself back into the real life and not living off the governmentI should not that no resume has been inactive for 6-7 years so that leaves a massive gap, I can't pass a police check due to a massive criminal record with violent and serious crimesNothing has worked out for me and every job trial or opportunity I find I end up having a paranoid episode or panic attack, this is why I'm looming for something from homeI've tried customer service, tele sales, appointment setter and all the other common stuff like that Most jobs either don't want me because of the record or the holes on my resume or I don't want the job because its dodgy and cold calling fund-raisingI'm hoping to find some cool niche jobs that after for such a mess like myself! Sorry for the rambling I hope I can find some answer here, bless you all!\n",

      "TW: mentions of death, panicI apologize for the length, my thoughts are everywhere and i just need to write this all out and let it out Ive been struggling with GAD, as long as I can remember and Panic disorder for a year Ive tried Celexa (40mg), which didnt really have any affect on me so I switched to Zoloft (100mg) which was helping with negative thoughts and panic attacks but I started feeling a bit emotionless, maybe it was too high a dosage? So i stopped taking that and I was on nothing for a couple of months I still had anxiety and the occasional panic attack build up Then life happened My grandpa passed away and I was a mess, I had several panic attacks that made me late to the funeral I just cried the whole funeral but I felt like I let go But my family had him flown back to his hometown in Mexico where we saw his funeral service through Facetime, I had to miss the burial because of work And my family planned a 9day mourning service (it is still happening but i have missed the past 7days) And we had to put our family dog down and found out my SOs old mentor passed away tooIn the middle of all this going on, I felt like it was time to go back on medication and wanted to try something else, and i was hopeful My dr seemed like she cared a lot and prescribed me amitriptyline (10mg) for anxiety and propranolol (10mg as needed) for panic attacks (Metformin(500mg) on top of that) I was fine and hopeful for a weekThen one night I had the most terrible panic attack with the most terrible negative thoughts and intrusive thoughts and this deep feeling of hopelessness and feeling like I was going to die and I just felt so lonely despite having my SO there with me holding me and trying to comfort me This panic attack lasted 4 days, peaking that first night The rest of the days, i had the nonstop numbnesstinglingcold feeling in my body and back of my head I had multiple crying spells and the hopelessness never stopped I only found relief when i was asleep I also lost all my appetite during this time I still dont get hungry, if i let myself, i would not eat anything all day and not even feel any hunger, which is scary because I LOVE food and I LOVE to eatI was never able to reach my PCP and i felt so desperate for escape or relief i almost ended up in the er or urgent care I ended up reaching out to a dr online and she was like a safety net for me and i saw her multiple times before i could see a psychiatrist I wasnt feeling much better and I kept having crying spells and cried while talking to her She ended up prescribing me buspirone (5mg 2day) to help calm me down Its been helping a bit but the negative thoughts are still there and I cant escape them and have resulted to mind numbing with Netflix until I could see the psychiatrist (Im also seeing a therapist but i just started with her and were working on CBT)I was feeling the smallest bit of hope today when I had my appt with the psychiatrist I told her everything thats happened and she told me she didnt think it was all the meds I was on that I felt caused that severe 4day panic attack, despite never having anything like that before or ever having these severe amount of negative thoughts before It made me feel like one of my deepest fears was right, Im just broken, its just me Part of me still thinks its the medications and now Im terrified of trying anything She told me Im having physical sensations because i dont have enough oxygen Ive been trying breathing exercises and meditation during this whole time so i just felt like she wasnt hearing how intense everything was for me and i kept choking up multiple times when i explained everythingI asked about going back on sertraline because its what Im familiar with but she was hesitant because she said I was specifying it for anxiety but i just want the negative thinking to stop She asked if i had depression and i didnt know how to answer because i dont know if i do, i thought she would have been able to figure out if i did during the appt I told her I wasnt sure but the past week+ has felt like it So she told me to start sertraline at 25mg while still on buspirone She said she didnt think it would cause severe side effects but I know its always an unknown with medicationI know meds take a while to kick in but I just felt so helpless talking to her and hearing what she had to say And there wasnt a lot of reassurance there, i know that meds are tricky but i was hoping to feel lighter afterwards And her reiterating how long everything would take to really kick in made me feel like I was pushed back into the black hole I felt I was slowly climbing out of I ended up crying afterwards because of how hopeless i felt and I had crying spells all day after Idk if its the state of mind Ive been in that made me react this way or if its even the “right” reaction to what she saidI ended up looking up buspirone + sertraline on reddit and i saw many people say good things, which gave me a bit of hope, but Im just extremely terrified, i dont know how much more i can handleThanks for sticking through this all, any words of kindness or assurance would be well needed and welcome For everyone else feeling similarly, youre not alone, i know its hard to be positive but it helps a bit to know its not just you\n",

      "I'm 17M I had gone through a very stressful period of my life in the first 2 weeks of November I even had panic attacks for 3 or 4 days I also began seeing spots in my vision and flashes of light This scared me, so I got my eyes checked through a dilated eye exam- my eyes were alright Basically my flashes are streaks of light that come from boundaries of surfaces and dark surfaces Example- if a book is kept on the table, then I see phosphenes from the edges for a second or so These flashes usually come from only bright surfaces, but now seem to be coming from every other object Also in the dark or on very bright surfaces I can see white spots (slightly bigger than dots) flashing around that have some bluish or yellowish or greenish boundary (just like the ones that we see on closing our eyes) Then I googled about it and read about visual snow The thing is I just see mild static which occasionally increases due to stressful situations, but I don't have anything like floaters, palinopsia, etc When I spent time with my friends for a couple of days my visual disturbances decreased a bit, but now it's again the same So my question is that since apart from my anxiety and visual stuff I am fine, are my visual sensations related to my high anxiety? Is it because of something like my eyes being hyperaware\n",

      "To preface this I'm not diagnosed and not seeking a diagnosis, but was hoping yall could shed some light All my life has felt like a sound wave of ups and downs, if that makes any sense And for the past couple days I was on one of those highs, where I felt especially social and extroverted (which is not me most of the time) where I had this above- average opinion of myself I felt like I could do anything and quite literally wrote my own language just to see if I could I also bought this big ass hat for way more money than I should've just because I was hanging out with friends and thought it was funny Now I feel like my normal self, not quite in a pit of depression but generally unhopeful about the future The things i was interested in seem pointless, boring, or stupid I know for sure I go through bouts of depression and I've found ways of coping, but every once in a while this erratic behavior surprises me Is this similar to mania?\n",

Anyone care to share their thoughts on this plz…\n",

      "So I just had the worst manic episode that Ive had in about three years The first one I, an agnostic atheist, got very into christianity, crystals, and gurus that I genuinely believed I was a messiah and decided to stop taking my medication Very VERY bad choice That was when I was 15 Im 18 now and about a month and a half ago I started to feel somewhat normal, then upbeat My depressive side is usually always out A little before the manic side stepped in i had a really bad panic attack and was ready to end my life, but was tackled by someone and stopped But I was developing new interests and didnt sleep much, I dropped out of school, chopped all my hair off, was ready to do some hard drugs, started smoking cigs, broke up with my gf and started to leave the house at random times I couldnt stay in one place for a long time or else I would get annoyed I also didnt have anyone to talk to because I cut everyone off I was ready to leave everyone behind and start a whole new life A little threat by my father to send me to the hospital stopped me a bit and after about three weeks I calmed down Then a couple days later I felt HORRIBLE Everything felt heavy I could barely get up in the morning I was getting constant nightmares again, which is a bad thing because the last time that happened I started hallucinating Had to cut off all horror movies As of right now I still feel absolutely horrible Im currently on Lamotrigine and have been since 2019 Ive tried guanfacine (idk if thats how you spell it) as well I was on lithium too but for some reason i felt like that actually made me manic I have been prescribed geodon by my doctor but Im currently waiting for my blood results Again, im still in a low phase These usually last a long time Honestly Im never not depressed I feel like crying constantly and even had a breakdown randomly in my dads car I just couldnt stop crying I started self harming again and my ocd mixed in is not helpful Im paranoid 247 and I cant do anything right I make mistakes with EVERYTHING I cry doing everything I dont like talking to my family but they look at me as a disappointment I dont have anyone to talk to so im alone and doing nothing all the time Im extremely suicidal at the moment For the past couple of days my head has felt foggy and heavy Almost had a ticklish or numb sensation I just want to die honestly I feel like my brain is different from everyone else I cant do anything right And I cant even attempt suicide right, i tried about two years ago and honestly looking back on it i laugh because again I COULDNT EVEN DO THAT RIGHT I feel so sick all the time and I really really hate myself I have a therapist and shes shit She just cares about me getting a job, job applications give me extreme paranoia btw it isnt an excuse so I havent really tried Ive also been feeling guilty over the past things ive sent and done to people  I know i should move on because its in the past theres nothing i can do now I hate myself truly I see myself as two different people and neither are the “real” me Its like she doesnt exist Im just a meat bag for two sick people The depressed loser( my current persona) and the manic one I cant concentrate on anything Any advice for a depressed loser? perhaps some coping mechanisms?\n",

      "I was diagnosed and medicated before I met my husband so he never really \"met\" the manic or depressed me I went off my medication last summer because i was totally stable for a whole year and my doctor, my therapist and I decided to try Went super well and all is fine until it suddenly isn´t   I started having panic attacks a few weeks ago So far it has only been three, i was not sure at all what is happening, i thought I have covid and I am suffocating but now I am very sure I am having panic attacks ( I even remembered I had panic attacks in my teens, something i totally blocked out of my memories)  So now to my problem - I feel like my husband is not really supportive and he doesn´t really understand what is going on He knows I was diagnosed bipolar, medicated, I go to therapy, have experienced a lot of trauma in my past relationship etc but still, I texted him at work yesterday saying I think I´m having an attack and I feel unwell and he was very supportive over text but when i came home he didn´t ask me how I was and when we went out for a cigarette together like we usually do when I come home he told me all about his exam and the answers and i just couldn´t process the information or even really listen, i was so overwhelmed I told him that I´m sorry but i just don´t have the ressources to really have a conversation atm and he got quiet He is not openly mad but he is hurt that I wont listen and i am so angry that he keeps demanding even in a time of crisis, I even tell him because luckily through all the therapy i learned how to communicate what i need Am I selfish?

      "tw: sexual abuseI forgot about very graphic instances of childhood sexual abuse in my life until only 3 months ago Much of the abuse happened when I was 5-6 and again when I was 10-13, both by two specific family members I have told my therapist this but I have not told her the details I think it's been jarring to remember events that have been blocked out of my brain for most of my life Ever since I moved far away from my home state, many more memories have come flooding back (which makes sense to me because i'm finally in a safe place)  One abuser is my severely mentally ill parent and another passed away about ten years ago The only people I have told are my ex-boyfriend who I consider an extremely close friend, and my therapistI never am able to speak about the details of the abuse without having a physical reaction I can talk about the feelings associated with it, but I Have been unable to verbalize what actually happened to me I *want* to get to a point where I can talk about it, but I don't know how to ever feel safe sharing this information with ANYONE Am I supposed to give details? Sometimes it feels like if I just say \"I was abused\" people will not take it seriously The details are horrific And I'm constantly scared, and continue to isolate and shut down like I did when I was a child  I want to be able to tell my friends and talk to them about it, but I never want to accidentally trigger someone, and honestly, I don't think my friends are equipped to handle such heavy topics But at the same time, I've been suffering in complete silence for most of my life  I guess my questions are: How do I cope with these memories coming back like 15 years later? Do I tell anyone, or do I keep it to myself because a bad reaction is worse than none? Will it help me heal if I can verbalize what happened to me?\n",

I've tried everything I can think of: Blue light blocking glasses, exercise, meditation, sleep hygiene habits (avoiding electronics, dark room, programmed alarms, relaxation exercises, and so on) I've been in therapy for a long time, but that never helped my sleep issues Looking for a therapist now after an insurance change and almost no therapist in my area takes my insurance, so that's also stressful as fuck Medication has also failed thus far I've been on Melatonin, Seroquel, Trazadone, Benadryl, and Prazosin (also a large number of anti-depressants- none of which helped AT ALL) Here's what happens: either these medications stop working after a week (tolerance), or they work so damn well that it's impossible for me to wake up (even if I physically get up, I'm a zombie and unproductive, so there's no point- even vigorous exercise upon waking doesn't help) I'm also on adderall for ADHD, which I'm worried might be contributing, but the insomnia was a huge issue way before I was diagnosed with ADHD, which happened 2 years after my PTSD diagnosis My next step is to demand a sleep study referral from my PCP, but I'm not sure that will help because it will just confirm what I already know I can't sleep because I'm stressed as fuckI used to have sleep apnea, but I've had multiple surgeries to correct it, but maybe they didn't work and it's still an issue, which may partially explain the poor quality sleepBut my main issue is that I can't fall asleep I generally stay asleep (unless I have a nightmare, but those are thankfully rare now) I'm sure there's lots of things I haven't tried and I'm just struggling to think of them I'll take any pointers I can I'm panicking about this and I'm not getting the help I need It's wreaking havoc on my life\n",

      "(posting from a throwaway for obvious reasons)long story short, when i was a kid, i went through several instances of medical trauma with varying degrees of severity, and other trauma i won't specify needlessly to say, looking at pictures of syringes and needles is impossible for me, hearing about childhood ilnesses makes me freeze, and the smell of that one specific sanitizer is enough to ruin my whole day about 2 years ago, i went through cognitive-behavioral therapy to deal with my fear of needles and with that fear only without addressing the actual source(s), since it was necessary for me to get a blood test to keep me on my medication after over 3 months of therapy, and being held down by 2 people, i finally got it now, ever since the news about the vaccine being ready, i decided to go back to that same therapist, and asked her whether we could also address the core of the problem, which is the trauma however, whenever i got emotional over it, she kept dismissing me, and tried to distract me i felt quite disappointed, and decided to find a new therapist immediately, and now i'm actually recovering, making slow, slow progressa few weeks ago, i decided to at least try to go to a vaccination point with my mom, to at least get a look around we slowly make our way into the lobby, and that's when it hits me that the place where i almost died in when i was 6 i couldn't even make it to the reception desk i broke down immediately and had to leave it's the only place where people in my age group can get vaccinated i don't know shat to do, i really don't i feel so horrible, i know i could just close my eyes, maybe try to calm down, but i just can't! last time i had to get vaccinated i had to be held down by *four people!* and still somehow managed to bite one of them in animal-like fear i went through covid pretty recently, so i still have a month or so until i can get vaccinated, but i'm still so scared i'll have to go there someday and face that, right?is anyone here in a similar situation? did you deal with it? can you please, please tell me how?\n",

      "I posted a bit of a different spin of this on the bipolar subreddit, but i just want to find someone with PTSD who relates at all i am scared, filled with shame, and feel like I am floating in space i have lied about atrocious things at first, I told white lies as a child i was abused sexually, physically, and emotionally at a young age, so that might have some correlation As i grew older, my lies have became more…malignant i guess? i am petrified I am a narcissist or sociopath or something, or at least was i started lying about everything achievements, exaggerated about knowing people who passed away or something, illnesses, getting revenge on my GF for being unfaithful by being unfaithful and lying to her, etc i would like to say these things were for no reason, but i think a lot of time i wanted to appear more together or interesting to distract from the bad memories, bad feelings, rumination, lack of control maybe? i felt so much vengeance against the world I didnt do anything crazy that forced me to stop lying…i just broke down back in april something came over me to tell me once and for all that i am absolute trash and i felt and feel like i retroactively deserved to be beaten, molested, etc my whole world crumbled around me when i had my first mixed episode then i got diagnosed with bipolar 1 and PTSD i realized that i had been such a lying, manipulative sack of garbage I created someone i was not I hurt people from lying and did so much bad stuff i was rotting and contributing such negativity to the world and erasing myself I cry a lot thinking about those times something changed me when my therapist at the time a few months ago had me put myself in a room (in my mind) with my child self and tell him “you are okay we feel a lot of shame together but i am going to be the protective adult you did not have” it also helped that i am on mood stabilizers and seroquel can anyone relate? is there a way i can be a truthful and good person from the inside? i havent really lied AT ALL in the past 6 months\n",
      "So I'm in therapy and we are going to start EMDR for traumas I have with my mom She used to tell me she hated me and wished i would die while she was drunk This happened every 3-4 month like clockwork most of my life She stopped 6 years ago when I said id never speak to her if she said that again Well, when my therapist asks me to think of a time that this happened, I cant think of anything I literally can't actually remember an instance this happened This has led me to question myself so much Apart of me even starts to wonder if i made this all up or if im exaggerating things that happened Its just so shitty because i know for a fact that this happened to me and have had conversations with others in my family this happened to too But still, my brains just telling me this and making me question everything I know that me not remembering these things is the way my body has protected itself, but it just makes it so hard I feel like im gaslighting myselfIdk, my therapist speculates a piece of this could be because my family has always down played this and hasn't viewed it as abuse Frequently growing up I was told things like, I need to not upset my mom, I'm a brat for getting so upset with my mom for things, and she doesn't really mean it its just the alcohol So maybe because its been down played so much around me, im doing it even to myself even though im deeply hurt by all this It makes sense but it doesn't ultimately make my brain stop saying these things or feel betterAnyone else expereince anything like this?

      "Posted on another sub as well Sorry for the long ass post, and I also suck at writing but anyway here is my military experience: I graduated high school in 2018 and shipped off to boot camp about two weeks later Boot camp is what it is After completing boot camp and the rest of my training, I arrived at my permanent duty station for the next three years in Okinawa, Japan This was March of 2019 and I was 19 years old I came with a buddy from my job school back in the states The first base I went to was potentially going to be my base, but I was told that my chain of command was going to send either me or my buddy to another base It ended up being me The base I had been at was really likable I liked my roommates, the Corporals I was going to serve under were friendly and very helpful, we became friends The base itself was a nice layout, to where you could walk to most of the main attractions on base no problem It was quiet too The new base they sent me too was just depressing and everyone there had a worse attitude I was filled with dread and deep sadness and I had to try so hard not to cry because everything was so overwhelming When I got to my unit, I met some of my peers and higher ups of my platoon They fucked with me a bit at first and for the first month or so that I was in this unit, I was acquainted with most of them I got fucked with a lot when I was new but it never really stopped and it got much worse It became personal On a daily basis, for the next 8 or so months, I was harassed, ostracized, and bullied And I got yelled at a lot but it was mostly over petty shit I am a person who is kind-hearted, but I was also very timid and not very muscular at the time, compared to my peers So I was naturally a target for bullies A few of the sergeants would get hammered and fuck with me hardcore at the barracks Sometimes they would try and start fights with me for no reason One junior marine headbutted me and chipped my tooth while he was drunk, but I later forgave him and we remained friends I was called names every day such as bitch, pussy, faggot, motherfucker, dickhead, fucker, fuckface, retard, piece of shit, square head, square face I was told I suck at my job, that I would never be as good as my predecessor, was told I was worthless, not a real marine, that I'm a stupid motherfucker, was told \"your sister is very hot and I wanna fuck her\" I was physically assaulted a couple times by peers I suffered this torment almost, if not every day This is only some of the behavior I experienced It was so demeaning Not to mention living with constant paranoia and fear of anyone higher ranking who would yell at me and demean me over petty shit and treat me like a child I was constantly walking on egg shells One particular incident led me to being administratively separated (kicked out) of the military It was 4th of July weekend 2019 and I was in a taxi on my way back to base from a concert I shit you not, somebody had left a closed bottle of Jack Daniels in a plastic bag in the back seat of the taxi One of those big 3 liter bottles Being 19 (and a minor at that) and wanting to drink I took the bottle back to my barracks room l drank all if not most of the bottle over the next day This is the moment all of my emotions from the past several months were released I recall it being about mid afternoon and I was hammered I was yelling vulgar shit at the top of my lungs into the hallway It had something to do with this girl I had known back at my job school in the states who had been a friend, who emotionally hurt me The marines on duty were just laughing at me saying that I was going to \"murder that lesbian bitch\" at the top of my lungs The next thing I remember before blacking out was playing video games in my room, and then I was throwing and breaking shit in my room, and then I was on the ground in a chokehold by my peer trying to get him to release me while threatening him I remember my roommates were there and the one sergeant who was a friend to me Then I remember crying hysterically, shouting down the hallways of the barracks that I was going to kill and rape certain people who had hurt me during my military career I was blacking out and coming to the whole time The next time I came to I was sitting on the couch in the barracks lounge surrounded by several of my higher ups, including officers, the duty, several military police officers, and a bunch of other people i didnt know The police were trying to calm me down and I just kept crying in agony and confusion I also recall noticing I had blood stain on my jeans To this day I still don't know who's blood it was or how it got there I blacked out yet again and the next thing I remember is being handcuffed to a hospital bed in a lobby, still balling like a baby and freaking out Then I remember waking up sober the next day in my hospital room I don't remember being arresteddetained or the ambulance ride to the hospital What a fucking night It was definitely the most distressing, most horrible night of my life My BAC was 218, the drunkest I have ever been This incident is what led me to being separated, in November 2019 Officially I left because of \"alcohol rehabilitation failure\" as I had refused to go to alcohol treatment and I knew I would be kicked out if I refused I just wanted to go home I wanted the abuse to just end and this was the only way The drinking incident probably prevented me from having a successful military career too I received a Non-Judicial Punishment, was demoted in rank, had my paycheck halved and had to do extra duties (cleaning the company headquarters building every day for two hours) for 60 days It was late October 2019 before I was ready to be sent back to the states I stayed in North Carolina for about a week before I went back home All of my family knows I left the military early, but not all of them know why When people ask if I did four years in the military I just say something along the lines of \"no I left because of personal medical reasons\" But I'm almost 22 so soon I'll be able to tell people I was in the military with them assuming I did four years I actually rarely tell people anymore Why do they always have to pry? It is kind of embarrassing to tell people that I left the military early because they probably think I am a failure or something But it's just because they don't understand or know what I went through I often wonder how my life and military career would have turned out if I wasn't given such a shitty hands of cards I also know that if I stayed in the military my mental health was never going to improve I was diagnosed with ptsd because of the abuse I received which has led me to having significantly difficult work and personal relationships My family supports me even though none of them know exactly what happened, unless they're reading this I guess I posted this to see if anyone has any supportive advice or similar experiences But mainly it feels good to finally tell someone else about my experience I've never talked in depth about it like this before so thanks for reading\n",

do actually have a problem and it's not just in my head I have been dealing with many of the effects of having an eating disorder but I'm in denial because my BMI is over 40 and like nobody would ever believe me if I told them I'm afraid to say hey guys I have ___ because I don't fit the mold and I'm not skinny what so ever And there were times I did get better I was in an institution where they fed me lots of calories and when I got sober at first I ate a lot for like 5 months I got to my highest weight ever and I was just like omg I am out of controlSo I started \"dieting\" again but it quickly turned into a game like the calorie goal kept getting lower When I was in my early 20s I starved myself for a year and got to my lowest adult weight But any time I ate normal I would start gaining weight And I had issues where I'd eat what I decided was too much So I did used to purge And make myself burn more calories I always fidget and rock and move I used to do cardio but something changed and I can't anymoreSo this time around I knew I had to lose weight somehow So I decided to try dieting again even though I feared things going back to how they were before I knew there were times when I was unhealthier but I couldn't really identify why it wasBut it quickly turned from a diet into something worse again That little voice that told me to stop eating and starve my body from calories so I wouldn't gain So I could try and lose But it never worked That stupid little voice I have a mirror facing my bed so everytime I get up and out I can look at myself and remember why I don't wanna eat too much And I get so starving I have to eat and then I tell myself it's bad food and feel guiltyI decided to do intermittent fasting sinve so many recommend it So I started with 168 But it turned into 24 X3 days a week Then 5 Over time the fasting got longer I didn't lose like a lot of weight though I tried very hard to only lose 30 pounds in a year I restricted more than what is recommended and according to my bmr and bmi I should have been losing at least 2 pounds a week or more even if I rate 1300 calories So I'd aim for 0 and then allow myself 300-500 for my omad if it was an eating day I mean on a bad day I'd eat over 1,000 calories and feel so guilty But a good day I wouldn't eat food at all And eventually it was two days Then l let myself eat food because you do need it to survive they say and I'm sure it's worse to starve harder I don't have the willpower to starve longer than 48 hours But for some reason that's just not what happened And it could be the whole starvation mode thing or that eating disorders won't actually help me lose weight But a little voice tells me I don't deserve a normal amount of food I'm not skinny enough to get help And I never will be But a coach on YouTube made a video that was my wake up on call I have so many side effects from this In the past years I've been to the er for c diff, ecoli, gi bleeding, constipation, gastroparesis I've had erosive esophagitis Bad gerd Amenorrhea Abdominal pain Only lost 30 pounds all year so it can't be that bad My esophagus was tore up And c diff almost killed me So I quit purging after ecoli and c diff at the same time I had a serious wake up call I became so ill and feared for my life and it sort of woke me up like I need to take care of myself betterbut I would have instances where I threw up blood My voice went away I had to swallow lidocaine to help numb the pain Like I wasn't well I had to get an endoscopy and they said no more ibuprofen because it would continue to get worseAnd the purging wasn't like consistent it only was like sometimes Mainly it's the restriction for me especially now I haven't purged in over a year I threw up so much blood and it scares me And the way the teeth are being rotted from behind them like my two front teeth are eroded on the back side My heart doesn't wanna let me exercise but the extreme fasting and eating fewer calories than I need is what makes me think I have a problem The way I'm obsessed withy body Pics Comparison The mirror Checking how clothes fit Yeah My pulse going crazy whenever I stand up or move I get chest pains But I realized like a bunch of the things I feel could be relatedMy body temp is always like 96-97 My heart doesn't typically get low like some people It never goes below 55 But it frequently gets to 170-180 when I'm up on my feet Idk Even my thyroid was a little off like I used to have hypothyroidism but it went slightly hyper but I didn't think it was serious enough for treatment and I thought treatment might make me fatterBut the video called me out it made me realize that just because I have a fat disorder and I'm not underweight doesn't make this a healthy lifestyle I need to talk to a professional Admit that this is an issue I'm struggling with And like get help for myselfI can tell I've lost a lot of muscle and I'm curious what my bones are like My like vitamin D3 is low but that's cuz I'm from MN and a vampire And I'm scared nobody will believe me that I could have an eating disorder and still be so big The little voice tells me I just need to

My parents have contacted my doctor as well and asked about getting discharged against medical advice and they responded with that they have to go over it with other people Its been around a week I feel as if theyre just throwing it under the rug and kind of saying “eh, well discuss it” I feel as if theyre not trying at all, after all, why would my doctor that admitted me here really go through the effort to discharge me Regardless, my main concern is the fact that my residential home stated that to get discharged AMA, I need permission from my doctor Is this true? And if not, isnt this illegal? I just feel like theyre sending my parents through loopholes and just phrasing things to completely avoid giving my parents the AMA forms Please any help would be very much appreciated Ive been in residential for about three weeks and put on around 10 pounds, my vital signs have drastically improved and overall im stable According to my treatment team here, I have another 2-3 weeks here, which id prefer not to do Again, any help would be great, thank you\n",

I'm not asking to be diagnosed, I have a feeling i'll figure it out once i turn 18, i'm just a bit confused, is this normal?

Therefore I can understand it betterThe second question is I feel like my brain is on fire and it's always on 247 and always working I've got tons of PTSDs And I never feel like I am safe I never heard voices well I did once where I only slept about 2 hours, but I know it was because of the lack of sleep and my lacking mental healthI feel like I should always go back to this bad mental state and I never understand why Maybe because it kind of feels like my comfort zone? I got out of it once, and that time was the best 2-3 years of my life, but I fell backI am just sad and I need a hug I went to psychiatry and It stressed me out so much I didn't even wanted to be there I went there to \"prove\" my then psychologist, to show her that they won't help And I did that like out of anger I feel like I am some kind of, Uhm maniac? Who always wants to prove others how and why are they wrong I don't understand why am I doing this and I even did that in kindergartenAny thoughts on the second question?\n",
      "So ever since I was like single digits I get these conversations in my head Its not like I hear them but its like recalling a voice Its always characters from things I like such as anime characters or game characters They talk to me and I talk back sometimes Im not who I am but somebody else I created like an oc of some sorts It happens randomly like a daydream Every day for as long as I remember I like to go and listen to music and whenever I do these characters have a conversation including myself in my head and they sing and do stuff to the music like watching a show Keep in mind I dont hear them, I just think of them talking to eachother This happens a lot and I start crying whenever I face the simple fact I was born with autism but was never diagnosed with schizophrenia My whole life Ive been an outcast of people who dont understand and when I have friends who say they do I know they dont and they wont be able to Im currently dealing with being abandoned, ever since an online friend came back my best friend has been playing games with them never giving themselves free time and when I ask to join they dont want me I start crying but the thoughts of characters in my head come back and start talking to me They make me feel better normally comfort characters When I started writing about how these characters come when Im upset, I started crying as I typed it and a character did in fact pop into my head When I tell people about these Im treated like a creep but idk These thoughts are never harmful people who know me know I wouldnt hurt a fly, sometimes the characters are villains in the things I like and I help them become a better person Im lost and idk what to do, thats what got me questioning if I have schizophrenia is this whole thing\n",
      "Was wondering if someone who is under antipsychotic medications especially in high doses are able to function in school, college or work? Eversince I've been on these medications I started to work less efficiently, less productively and cannot do well in time management initially (these symptoms are improving as time passes by) The antispychotics I am on are dopamine antagonists (risperidone and haloperidol) which make it harder for me to do things because I cannot enjoy derive pleasure from doing them Everything feels dull I can barely even do household chores Ive been out of school for four years because of my mental illness I am slowly recovering though and is now stable I am wondering if anyone has gotten back to school and handle all the stress even if youre in these medications I had gotten dumber, lazy and dysfunctional when I started the meds, but i noticed ive improved when the medicine dose decreased I dont think my doctor would reduce my meds anytime soon and I already want to get back to school Ive been studying some random stuff while at home so I think I might be able to handle school my doctor told me there are schizophrenic patients that successfully became doctors, police officers and etc which sort of came across to me as a load of crap when I did some research since mentally ill people arent qualified to become police officers I think he is lying to me\n",

      "Hey, just wanted to put a post out there to give someone who is looking for hope About 2 years ago I developed schizophrenia and went into a deep psychosis I was put on involuntary Invega - the most zombifying of all the schizophrenia drugs - for a year I then was put on rexulti for approx 6-7 months Yesterday, my Pdoc said I was stable enough to go off my medsI was really sick on the invega - massive brain fog, could barely talk Coming off the meds, I feel like myself again for the first time in a very long time Focus on recovery If you are on street drugs, wean yourself off them Aim for the best job you can get and to get off disability Working is hard but gets easier as time goes on and your brain becomes higher functioning Aim for the lowest level of drugs that keep you sane Stay away from people and places and things that hinder your recovery So much of this disease is not within your control - but fight for every single scrap that is in your control I never thought I would get better or recover after invega - and now I'm at 95% Keep fighting the good fight!\n",

I was diagnosed with Schizoaffective disorder last February after a suicide attemptToday I was laying to bed with my boyfriend (I just woke up from a nap) and I start talking very very weird I guess, thats how my boyfriend describes it But the thing is, to me my words sounded completely correct Like he would ask my questions and I would respond with what o was thinking but it came out broken? Like the words werent In the right places, sometimes I would say something completely unrelated, its was choppy and I was a little giggly He seemed really confused and I understood that, I heard the concern In his voice but I could not help myself but laugh as I continued to spew the random, disorganized sentences in response to his questionsIt eventually stopped and looking back I do think it was disorganized speech It just caught me off guard because thats never happened before but the voices have started coming back and Ive been seeing stuff so I think I might be starting to go down the rabbit hole againNo worries tho!

No more hallucinations Even reality doesnt seem as off (feels like a warm positive hallucination of love) but otherwise I can reality check Delusions are fine and when I question their existence they seem to crumble But the fear is still real at times, but Im learning to let go Gangstalking isnt real right?

I'm a psychology major and in psychology it's unacceptable if a therapist says that but just making sure that I'm not being too sensitive or overreacting : And when I said that this word is not professional and isn't a good term bc people with schizophrenia are more than an illness she went and gave me a whole ass lecture on why it's ok to say that and that the patient needs to knows that they have an issue and seek help Also she keeps focusing on cognitive therapy and saying that medicine helps only about 30% and that without her kind of therapy nobody would get better like?? She also keeps pushing her type of therapy in every fucking conversation we have in our group that I'm starting to think that she's taking advantage of the patients And when a patient asked about the difference between psychosis and schizophrenia she said that paychosis is a mental illness when it's a symptom :| and that schizophrenia is a freaking neurotic disorder!!! and keeps telling everyone that schizophrenia is caused by traumatic events even tho this isn't true in most cases and promises everyone that she is going to cure them if they keep coming to her sessionsSince I'm a paranoid person I'm not sure if I can trust what I feel so I'd rather ask here to see everyone else's thoughts on her I hope I'm not just looking into a non-existing issue tho xD\n",
