Much of the abuse happened when I was 5-6 and again when I was 10-13, both by two specific family members. I have told my therapist this but I have not told her the details. I think it's been jarring to remember events that have been blocked out of my brain for most of my life. Ever since I moved far away from my home state, many more memories have come flooding back (which makes sense to me because i'm finally in a safe place).  \n\n\nOne abuser is my severely mentally ill parent and another passed away about ten years ago. The only people I have told are my ex-boyfriend who I consider an extremely close friend, and my therapist.\n\nI never am able to speak about the details of the abuse without having a physical reaction. I can talk about the feelings associated with it, but I Have been unable to verbalize what actually happened to me. I *want* to get to a point where I can talk about it, but I don't know how to ever feel safe sharing this information with ANYONE. Am I supposed to give details? Sometimes it feels like if I just say \"I was abused\" people will not take it seriously. The details are horrific. And I'm constantly scared, and continue to isolate and shut down like I did when I was a child.  \nI want to. be able to tell my friends and talk to them about it, but I never want to accidentally trigger someone, and honestly, I don't think my friends are equipped to handle such heavy topics.

And i\u2019ve been kind of suffering from PTSD from working from that sh*t toxic manager since then (though i had only worked with her for a month). \n\nShe would micromanage me intensively (eg we were working from home. And she would check in with me everyday in the afternoon and wants me to list down everything that i\u2019ve been doing since the morning). \n\nEven before the day starts (like the night before or late in the evening), she would be spamming me with emails for things that needs to be *urgently completed* by noon the next day. \n\nBecause i deal with recruitment as well for my job, and there multiple vacancies within the company. She expected me to be clearing ALL resumes for ALL job vacancies for like 3-4 job portals every single day (not forgetting recruitment is only 30% of all of my job scope). \n\nEven after i tendered and on my last working day, she stayed in the office with me (and also she demanded me to come in to the office daily for \u201chandover\u201d though technically it could be done via online, when the default work mode was still wfh). And on my last working day, that psychotic b*tch forced me to finish up more work till THE EXACT MINUTE THAT I CLOCKED OFF WORK. \n \nThough i am glad i escaped from that hell hole of working for her shortly, i also have ptsd and it put me off accepting other job offers for the next couple of months. \n\nI recently (finally) accepted another offer, and started work.

And he didn't encourage them to try to keep in touch with me and I could tell he was filling their ears with a bunch of garbage because of little things my daughter would say to me every now and then back when I was still in touch with them.\n\nWhile we were married I know he was unfaithful and he did some really messed up things in our marriage but I was by no means perfect and we had our issues but I never EVER once told the kids about any of his dumpster fire garbage.\n\nAnyway I am just fucking furious at him and what a liar and a backstabbing asshole he is.

The combo wreaks havoc on my sleep. My sleep quality is always poor, and it takes me forever to fall asleep. Sometimes all night. I'm in grad school and it's jeopardizing my progress in the program, which is causing me constant stress (which of course makes it harder to sleep- catch-22 for the win, am I right?). \n\nI've tried everything I can think of: Blue light blocking glasses, exercise, meditation, sleep hygiene habits (avoiding electronics, dark room, programmed alarms, relaxation exercises, and so on). I've been in therapy for a long time, but that never helped my sleep issues. Looking for a therapist now after an insurance change and almost no therapist in my area takes my insurance, so that's also stressful as fuck. \n\nMedication has also failed thus far. I've been on Melatonin, Seroquel, Trazadone, Benadryl, and Prazosin (also a large number of anti-depressants- none of which helped AT ALL). Here's what happens: either these medications stop working after a week (tolerance), or they work so damn well that it's impossible for me to wake up (even if I physically get up, I'm a zombie and unproductive, so there's no point- even vigorous exercise upon waking doesn't help). \n\nI'm also on adderall for ADHD, which I'm worried might be contributing, but the insomnia was a huge issue way before I was diagnosed with ADHD, which happened 2 years after my PTSD diagnosis. \n\nMy next step is to demand a sleep study referral from my PCP, but I'm not sure that will help because it will just confirm what I already know. I can't sleep because I'm stressed as fuck.\n\nI used to have sleep apnea, but I've had multiple surgeries to correct it, but maybe they didn't work and it's still an issue, which may partially explain the poor quality sleep.\n\nBut my main issue is that I can't fall asleep. I generally stay asleep (unless I have a nightmare, but those are thankfully rare now). \n\nI'm sure there's lots of things I haven't tried and I'm just struggling to think of them. I'll take any pointers I can. I'm panicking about this and I'm not getting the help I need.

lied about atrocious things. at first, I told white lies as a child. i was abused sexually, physically, and emotionally at a young age, so that might have some correlation. \n\nAs i grew older, my lies have became more\u2026malignant i guess? i am petrified I am a narcissist or sociopath or something, or at least was. \n\ni started lying about everything. achievements, exaggerated about knowing people who passed away or something, illnesses, getting revenge on my GF for being unfaithful by being unfaithful and lying to her, etc. i would like to say these things were for no reason, but i think a lot of time i wanted to appear more together or interesting to distract from the bad memories, bad feelings, rumination, lack of control maybe? i felt so much vengeance against the world. \n\nI didn\u2019t do anything crazy that forced me to stop lying\u2026i just broke down back in april. something came over me to tell me once and for all that i am absolute trash. and i felt and feel like i retroactively deserved to be beaten, molested, etc. \n\nmy whole world crumbled around me when i had my first mixed episode. then i got diagnosed with bipolar 1 and PTSD. i realized that i had been such a lying, manipulative sack of garbage. I created someone i was not. I hurt people from lying and did so much bad stuff. i was rotting and contributing such negativity to the world and erasing myself. \n\nI cry a lot thinking about those times. something changed me when my therapist at the time a few months ago had me put myself in a room (in my mind) with my child self and tell him \u201cyou are okay. we feel a lot of shame together but i am going to be the protective adult you did not have.\u201d it also helped that i am on mood stabilizers and seroquel. \n\ncan anyone relate? is there a way i can be a truthful and good person from the inside? i havent really lied AT ALL in the past 6 months.", "send_replies": true, "spoiler": false, "stickied": false, "subreddit": "ptsd", "subreddit_id": "t5_2qm0x", "subreddit_subscribers": 67138, "subreddit_type": "public", "suggested_sort": "new", "thumbnail": "self", "title": "PTSD and pathological lying?", "total_awards_received": 0, "treatment_tags": [], "upvote_ratio": 1.0, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/ptsd/comments/r7i0qm/ptsd_and_pathological_lying/", "whitelist_status": "no_ads", "wls": 0}, {"all_awardings": [], "allow_live_comments": false, "author": "GatoBlanco_", "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_flair_text": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "author_fullname": "t2_e35p9511", "author_is_blocked": false, "author_patreon_flair": false, "author_premium": false, "awarders": [], "can_mod_post": false, "contest_mode": false, "created_utc": 1638486687, "domain": "self.ptsd", "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/ptsd/comments/r7jzqy/so_im_in_trauma_therapy_and_im_realizing_i_dont/", "gildings": {}, "id": "r7jzqy", "is_created_from_ads_ui": false, "is_crosspostable": true, "is_meta": false, "is_original_content": false, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "is_robot_indexable": true, "is_self": true, "is_video": false, "link_flair_background_color": "#ed719e", "link_flair_css_class": "support", "link_flair_richtext": [], "link_flair_template_id": "6571129a-dae3-11e4-a528-22000b3107f5", "link_flair_text": "Support", "link_flair_text_color": "dark", "link_flair_type": "text", "locked": false, "media_only": false, "no_follow": true, "num_comments": 8, "num_crossposts": 0, "over_18": false, "parent_whitelist_status": "no_ads", "permalink": "/r/ptsd/comments/r7jzqy/so_im_in_trauma_therapy_and_im_realizing_i_dont/", "pinned": false, "pwls": 0, "retrieved_on": 1638486698, "score": 1, "selftext": "So I'm in therapy and we are going to start EMDR for traumas I have with my mom.

I literally can't actually remember an instance this happened. This has led me to question myself so much. Apart of me even starts to wonder if i made this all up or if im exaggerating things that happened. Its just so shitty because i know for a fact that this happened to me and have had conversations with others in my family this happened to too. But still, my brains just telling me this and making me question everything. I know that me not remembering these things is the way my body has protected itself, but it just makes it so hard. I feel like im gaslighting myself.\n\nIdk, my therapist speculates a piece of this could be because my family has always down played this and hasn't viewed it as abuse. Frequently growing up I was told things like, I need to not upset my mom, I'm a brat for getting so upset with my mom for things, and she doesn't really mean it its just the alcohol. So maybe because its been down played so much around me, im doing it even to myself even though im deeply hurt by all this.

When I compare dreams to my sister(we have similar trauma) or friends most of the time they have dreams similar to real life situations. It's difficult to describe what I dream about, very few of mine even take place on earth. I'm in white rooms, blank spaces, one specifically I was in a school but when I looked out the window there's nothing outside. Where I am always has objects nearby to interact with. I've seen distorted versions of myself in mirrors, I open neverending doors and a few times I've ran aimlessly down empty roads. Sometimes there's monsters, I've seen just the shape of a human, that had no features it was just covered in skin, it chased after my sister and I in a pool. I also saw a giant with millions of eyes, it had two heads connected at the mouth, four arms, it wasn't shaped like anything. I've seen lots of strange things but i cant go on all day. I have cptsd and I know this can cause unpleasant dreams, even if they don't scare me I still feel my heart rate speed up and often wake up in a cold sweat. Its amazing trauma can affect your brain this much, invading your dreams manifesting in weird symbolism. After all the things that happened I cant even have nice dreams... Instead I have to see one of my old teachers remove lizards from leg with pliers.

So no, I\u2019m sorry you don\u2019t get to judge me, you don\u2019t get to tell me what I need to be doing or what is best for me. I have paved my way in blood sweat and tears. And despite everything this world has put me through I am still a good person. I am a better person than most actually. I am respectful and considerate because I know what it\u2019s like to feel worthless I know what it\u2019s like to put a gun to your head I know what it\u2019s like to be so desperate to feel better that you\u2019re willing to stick a needle in your arm. I have love in my heart because I know how dark it really does get. I am proud of the man I am today. I\u2019m glad I\u2019m different. I wouldn\u2019t trade who I am for a anyone else.

Ultimately it\u2019s up to me to figure out but was just wondering anyone else\u2019s experience with this, or repressed memories in general. \n\n:]", "send_replies": true, "spoiler": false, "stickied": false, "subreddit": "ptsd", "subreddit_id": "t5_2qm0x", "subreddit_subscribers": 67168, "subreddit_type": "public", "suggested_sort": "new", "thumbnail": "self", "title": "Repressed memories surfaced in a dream?", "total_awards_received": 0, "treatment_tags": [], "upvote_ratio": 1.0, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/ptsd/comments/r7v6hl/repressed_memories_surfaced_in_a_dream/", "whitelist_status": "no_ads", "wls": 0}, {"all_awardings": [], "allow_live_comments": false, "author": "katzam95", "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_flair_text": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "author_fullname": "t2_8bui1vpr", "author_is_blocked": false, "author_patreon_flair": false, "author_premium": false, "awarders": [], "can_mod_post": false, "contest_mode": false, "created_utc": 1638531404, "domain": "self.ptsd", "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/ptsd/comments/r7x8mr/trauma_timeline_in_therapyart_therapy/", "gildings": {}, "id": "r7x8mr", "is_created_from_ads_ui": false, "is_crosspostable": true, "is_meta": false, "is_original_content": false, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "is_robot_indexable": true, "is_self": true, "is_video": false, "link_flair_background_color": "#007373", "link_flair_css_class": "resource", "link_flair_richtext": [], "link_flair_template_id": "714a8c0e-dae3-11e4-a786-22000b690122", "link_flair_text": "Resource", "link_flair_text_color": "light", "link_flair_type": "text", "locked": false, "media_only": false, "no_follow": true, "num_comments": 0, "num_crossposts": 0, "over_18": false, "parent_whitelist_status": "no_ads", "permalink": "/r/ptsd/comments/r7x8mr/trauma_timeline_in_therapyart_therapy/", "pinned": false, "pwls": 0, "retrieved_on": 1638531415, "score": 1, "selftext": "I presented my trauma narrative to my therapist last night. I spent 3 weeks working on this timeline as an art expression. Creating the piece didn't take me nearly as long as the cognitive process of organizing what I thought it should look like. It was extremely therapeutic for me to be able to represent what I see when I look back, and how I feel. \n\nI first tried to draw out each traumatic event as generalized bubble shapes on a page. I knew each section of trauma had to be varying degrees of intensity so I played around with representing that. My breakthrough in the piece came when I realized the colors had to be fleshy. So I made a geographical representation of a wound on skin. All the while, writing journal entries for my therapist about the stuff that was coming up for me, and giving background and contexts to the traumatic events I would be discussing.\n\nI did this with watercolor, so while I waited for the piece to dry I would switch to a different page and let my brain just vomit shapes on to that 2nd page. I used the same fleshy colors on that piece. So essentially creating two paintings at once.\n\nI described the intentional narrative and the brain vomit page as my dual brain. When I put it chronologically it's the intentional narrative that I see. I see the sequence; it's fuzzy, painful, and hard to decipher (similar to the aesthetic of my timeline). When I remove the facts and close my eyes and check in with my feelings around my trauma, it's my brain vomit page that represents that. My dual brain occurs with traumatic memories and I experience the split. \n\nI'm not very open about my PTSD, and it's still a new diagnosis for me. So when my friends and family saw the pieces, I just asked them how it makes them feel. I was very surprised to learn the emotions that came up for them coincided with the feelings I had while creating the art, so really just the tiniest bit of how I felt during my trauma. To have my loved ones say those emotions out loud made me feel like I was able to share without giving them all the gorey details....and it's impossible to describe the gratitude I get from that in words.\n\nIf anyone is interested I can post the pictures of my pieces on here but I wanted to share my art process in hopes that it could help someone else get through constructing their story.\n\nIf you need guidance and education on PTSD there's a book that discusses how the brain and the body function on PTSD, as well as plentiful studies done over decades of research. It's called The Body Keeps the Score and my therapist recommended it to me. It has been an INTEGRAL part of my healing process.\n\nIn no way am I done healing and I know I have much treatment to come yet. I have horrible days. Some of my worst days are occuring recently. But the healing process is still early for me and I wanted to post real optimistic proof of the tangible healing I've been experiencing and I hope this can help some of you find some guidance on how to proceed with your healing journey as well.\n\n\nThanks for reading, take care &lt;3", "send_replies": true, "spoiler": false, "stickied": false, "subreddit": "ptsd", "subreddit_id": "t5_2qm0x", "subreddit_subscribers": 67173, "subreddit_type": "public", "suggested_sort": "new", "thumbnail": "self", "title": "Trauma Timeline in therapy/art therapy", "total_awards_received": 0, "treatment_tags": [], "upvote_ratio": 0.99, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/ptsd/comments/r7x8mr/trauma_timeline_in_therapyart_therapy/", "whitelist_status": "no_ads", "wls": 0}, {"all_awardings": [], "allow_live_comments": false, "author": "PureFud80", "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_flair_text": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "author_fullname": "t2_59j9f00v", "author_is_blocked": false, "author_patreon_flair": false, "author_premium": true, "awarders": [], "can_mod_post": false, "contest_mode": false, "created_utc": 1638531584, "domain": "self.ptsd", "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/ptsd/comments/r7xaak/selfdestruct_mode/", "gildings": {}, "id": "r7xaak", "is_created_from_ads_ui": false, "is_crosspostable": true, "is_meta": false, "is_original_content": false, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "is_robot_indexable": true, "is_self": true, "is_video": false, "link_flair_background_color": "#ffb000", "link_flair_css_class": "venting", "link_flair_richtext": [], "link_flair_template_id": "b48cb46a-dae3-11e4-96c9-22000bb30a57", "link_flair_text": "Venting", "link_flair_text_color": "dark", "link_flair_type": "text", "locked": false, "media_only": false, "no_follow": true, "num_comments": 6, "num_crossposts": 0, "over_18": false, "parent_whitelist_status": "no_ads", "permalink": "/r/ptsd/comments/r7xaak/selfdestruct_mode/", "pinned": false, "pwls": 0, "retrieved_on": 1638531595, "score": 1, "selftext": "Does anyone else get completely overwhelmed with their feelings and just go in to a major self destruct mode? \nI am completely sick to death of people and their shit and am definitely on a self destruct path right now.", "send_replies": true, "spoiler": false, "stickied": false, "subreddit": "ptsd", "subreddit_id": "t5_2qm0x", "subreddit_subscribers": 67173, "subreddit_type": "public", "suggested_sort": "new", "thumbnail": "self", "title": "Self-destruct mode", "total_awards_received": 0, "treatment_tags": [], "upvote_ratio": 1.0, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/ptsd/comments/r7xaak/selfdestruct_mode/", "whitelist_status": "no_ads", "wls": 0}, {"all_awardings": [], "allow_live_comments": false, "author": "SnooDonuts9423", "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_flair_text": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "author_fullname": "t2_4qcesi0w", "author_is_blocked": false, "author_patreon_flair": false, "author_premium": false, "awarders": [], "can_mod_post": false, "contest_mode": false, "created_utc": 1638533431, "domain": "self.ptsd", "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/ptsd/comments/r7xs7b/trouble_functioning/", "gildings": {}, "id": "r7xs7b", "is_created_from_ads_ui": false, "is_crosspostable": true, "is_meta": false, "is_original_content": false, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "is_robot_indexable": true, "is_self": true, "is_video": false, "link_flair_background_color": "#ed719e", "link_flair_css_class": "support", "link_flair_richtext": [], "link_flair_template_id": "6571129a-dae3-11e4-a528-22000b3107f5", "link_flair_text": "Support", "link_flair_text_color": "dark", "link_flair_type": "text", "locked": false, "media_only": false, "no_follow": true, "num_comments": 1, "num_crossposts": 0, "over_18": false, "parent_whitelist_status": "no_ads", "permalink": "/r/ptsd/comments/r7xs7b/trouble_functioning/", "pinned": false, "pwls": 0, "retrieved_on": 1638533442, "score": 1, "selftext": "I can't leave the house, stay over at friends houses, be in friends' cars, or go on dates unless the person goes to my house.

Sorry for the long ass post, and I also suck at writing but anyway here is my military experience: I graduated high school in 2018 and shipped off to boot camp about two weeks later. Boot camp is what it is. After completing boot camp and the rest of my training, I arrived at my permanent duty station for the next three years in Okinawa, Japan. This was March of 2019 and I was 19 years old. I came with a buddy from my job school. back in the states. The first base I went to was potentially going to be my base, but I was told that my chain of command was going to send either me or my buddy to another base. It ended up being me. The base I had been at was really likable. I liked my roommates, the Corporals I was going to serve under were friendly and very helpful, we became friends. The base itself was a nice layout, to where you could walk to most of the main attractions on base no problem. It was quiet too. The new base they sent me too was just depressing and everyone there had a worse attitude. I was filled with dread and deep sadness and I had to try so hard not to cry because everything was so overwhelming. When I got to my unit, I met some of my peers and higher ups of my platoon. They fucked with me a bit at first and for the first month or so that I was in this unit, I was acquainted with most of them. I got fucked with a lot when I was new but it never really stopped and it got much worse. It became personal. On a daily basis, for the next 8 or so months, I was harassed, ostracized, and bullied. And I got yelled at a lot but it was mostly over petty shit. I am a person who is kind-hearted, but I was also very timid and not very muscular at the time, compared to my peers. So I was naturally a target for bullies. A few of the sergeants would get hammered and fuck with me hardcore at the barracks. Sometimes they would try and start fights with me for no reason. One junior marine headbutted me and chipped my tooth while he was drunk, but I later forgave him and we remained friends. I was called names every day such as bitch, pussy, faggot, motherfucker, dickhead, fucker, fuckface, retard, piece of shit, square head, square face. I was told I suck at my job, that I would never be as good as my predecessor, was told I was worthless, not a real marine, that I'm a stupid motherfucker, was told \"your sister is very hot and I wanna fuck her\". I was physically assaulted a couple times by peers. I suffered this torment almost, if not every day. This is only some of the behavior I experienced. It was so demeaning. Not to mention living with constant paranoia and fear of anyone higher ranking who would yell at me and demean me over petty shit and treat me like a child. I was constantly walking on egg shells. One particular incident led me to being administratively separated (kicked out) of the military. It was 4th of July weekend 2019 and I was in a taxi on my way back to base from a concert. I shit you not, somebody had left a closed bottle of Jack Daniels in a plastic bag in the back seat of the taxi. One of those big 3 liter bottles. Being 19 (and a minor at that) and wanting to drink I took the bottle back to my barracks room. l drank all if not most of the bottle over the next day. This is the moment all of my emotions from the past several months were released. I recall it being about mid afternoon and I was hammered. I was yelling vulgar shit at the top of my lungs into the hallway. It had something to do with this girl I had known back at my job school in the states who had been a friend, who emotionally hurt me. The marines on duty were just laughing at me saying that I was going to \"murder that lesbian bitch\" at the top of my lungs. The next thing I remember before blacking out was playing video games in my room, and then I was throwing and breaking shit in my room, and then I was on the ground in a chokehold by my peer trying to get him to release me while threatening him. I remember my roommates were there and the one sergeant who was a friend to me. Then I remember crying hysterically, shouting down the hallways of the barracks that I was going to kill and rape certain people who had hurt me during my military career. I was blacking out and coming to the whole time. The next time I came to I was sitting on the couch in the barracks lounge surrounded by several of my higher ups, including officers, the duty, several military police officers, and a bunch of other people i didnt know. The police were trying to calm me down and I just kept crying in agony and confusion. I also recall noticing I had blood stain on my jeans. To this day I still don't know who's blood it was or how it got there. I blacked out yet again and the next thing I remember is being handcuffed to a hospital bed in a lobby, still balling like a baby and freaking out. Then I remember waking up sober the next day in my hospital room. I don't remember being arrested/detained or the ambulance ride to the hospital. What a fucking night. It was definitely the most distressing, most horrible night of my life. My BAC was .218, the drunkest I have ever been. This incident is what led me to being separated, in November 2019. Officially I left because of \"alcohol rehabilitation failure\" as I had refused to go to alcohol treatment and I knew I would be kicked out if I refused. I just wanted to go home. I wanted the abuse to just end and this was the only way. The drinking incident probably prevented me from having a successful military career too. I received a Non-Judicial Punishment, was demoted in rank, had my paycheck halved and had to do extra duties (cleaning the company headquarters building every day for two hours) for 60 days. It was late October 2019 before I was ready to be sent back to the states. I stayed in North Carolina for about a week before I went back home. All of my family knows I left the military early, but not all of them know why. When people ask if I did four years in the military I just say something along the lines of \"no I left because of personal medical reasons.\" But I'm almost 22 so soon I'll be able to tell people I was in the military with them assuming I did four years. I actually rarely tell people anymore. Why do they always have to pry? It is kind of embarrassing to tell people that I left the military early because they probably think I am a failure or something. But it's just because they don't understand or know what I went through. I often wonder how my life and military career would have turned out if I wasn't given such a shitty hands of cards. I also know that if I stayed in the military my mental health was never going to improve. I was diagnosed with ptsd because of the abuse I received which has led me to having significantly difficult work and personal relationships. My family supports me even though none of them know exactly what happened, unless they're reading this. I guess I posted this to see if anyone has any supportive advice or similar experiences. But mainly it feels good to finally tell someone else about my experience.

When im on the highway in the passenger seat, and I feel the car moving underneath me, and they are driving, i feel like the car is going to crash and im going to die. im feeling my life flash before my eyes, I feel like im going to die and I cant turn it off, most fear you can imagine and thats what im feeling. I start sweating amd shaking, holding on to the door and twitching, almost on verge of crying out of fear, stomach feels sick, and im doing my best to hold it all inside but they can tell and I can tell their mad at me.\n\nIm sad because I feel all these things. At first everyone cares, they are understanding but over time they expect you to turn off how you feel. Today I was told to \"please don't do that today\". Im strong, you know, I try to hide it as best i can, I still ride in cars, i act like im okay and im still living my life. I wish I could never ride in anyone's car ever. I have my own car but today its not appropriate to take my car. \n\nToday there was a family member in the hospital. I asked to drive but was told the person that was grieving that today they couldn't stand to be in the passenger seat doing nothing. I asked because I know that I dont want to go through it and this but im told to suck it up basically so I do. Now I feel retramtized and I cant talk to anyone because I dont want to make it about me.

Through the next couple of months, I received my CPR and Basic Life Support training in order to assist my fellow squad mates and firefighters in medical care.

Two young children were died of smoke inhalation in the house and the mother tried to run back in to save them. She was seriously burned and helivaced out of the scene.

His two best friends came over that Saturday and as they went through my dad\u2019s binder of all of his inventions (he was a mechanical engineer and the smartest, wittiest man I\u2019ve ever known and had 30+ patents) I went grocery shopping. Came home and his buddy handed me a small hand gun that he took from my father\u2019s bedroom that he was showing off. Me? I\u2019ve been hospitalized so many times for trying to take my own life, so I called my uncle, who\u2019s a lawyer, to come get the gun. The next day, Sunday, dad wouldn\u2019t get out of bed. Soiled himself. Asked for morphine (he refused any drugs that could be addictive). I called my kid brother, he came over and we called hospice. They sent two nurses out immediately. My brother was dealing with the financials and legalities and I was with the other nurse dealing with his meds and personal details. I was the last to see him. I squeezed his toes and told him he\u2019d be home in a few days after some good pain relief. \nThere was a \u201cpop\u201d \nAnyhow, my hands locked. I couldn\u2019t hold my phone. To call anyone. I went numb. Every body part felt like \u201cit fell asleep\u201d. \nHe died the next day. Christmas Eve. \nMy hands are locked now. My face is fuzzy.
