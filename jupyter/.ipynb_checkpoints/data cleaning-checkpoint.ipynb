      "I'm a sophomore in college, and last semester was super busy. I immersed myself in a lot of activities last year, mostly because I was really depressed and needed things to do on campus. I've enjoyed all the things I'm a part of now though, but it definitely takes up a lot of time. I should have searched for more internships last semester, but I procrastinated and was also sick all the time. I applied for a big internship that was through my school, but I didn't get it, and I didn't look into any other internshipsI'm going back to school in a couple weeks and the stress is really settling in. There haven't been many new postings and there aren't any for the summer. I keep trying to start researching but I panic so much and the stress eats at me. I'm just extremely worried for the future, that I won't be able to get an internship or a job, or that I'll be falling behind.\n",
      "this year is my major exams. I just came back from a long school holiday but I feel drained. really drained. I can't think straight, I'm making mistakes during homework. I have tried playing a game of call of duty but just seem to continue being bothered. Im constantly worrying which deprives me of sleep. The major exams thing is just bugging me. I even started on more enrichment classes to help to stop me from worrying even more. The only time I wouldn't worry is with my best friend. But I just feel my teachers wouldn't allow me to be seated with him. He distracts me from all my worries. With my schedule being so packed now, I don't know if I can spend time with him. idk what to do now. thanks for listening me rant\n",
      "So at my school we have Monday of regular classes and then tuesday wednesday and thursday are finals. Well i went into a heart  dangerous arrhythmia that afternoon and had to go to the hospital where my 17 year old athletic self almost went into cardiac arrest as i went into Vfib. I had a heart ablation the day after and missed all of my tests. If i wouldn't of gone to the ER that night i would of gone into Vfib while studying and died within minutes(Sudden Cardiac Death). My teachers are all understanding but now i have to go back to school tomorrow and figure out how to fit 6 1-2 hour tests in 55 minute class periods. I don't want to miss class tomorrow i need one day back to school after missing three weeks due to winter break and recovery. Is there anyone who has missed Midterms or Finals who came up with a good makeup plan. I just need a day or two to go over stuff and have a normal routine as some of my classes changed over the semester. I understand i had all of break to study but i seriously almost died and i find it hard to study during recoveryholidays.\n",

      "I have been burnt out for months now, I go through cycles that start with being stressed and overwhelmed and end with me feeling suicidal and exhibiting a lot of depression symptoms.  Back in September I felt like the cycle was starting up again and tried to be proactive and get help from a counsellortherapist.  Since then I have seen 3 different people at 2 different places and nobody took me seriously.  I kept my request pretty simple, I want to find sress management techniques that dont involve mindfulness or meditation or anything like that.  I have practised mindfullness and meditation for nearly a decade and the results were extremely negative.  I figured that cant be the only way to manage stress, but it seems like everywhere I look it all says mindfulness.My last appointment I tested in the green for streds despite feeling completely burnt out.  I feel like the test questions didnt represent my situation, but idk it was developed by professionals.  Guy #3 kept asking me what techniques I was using to manage my stress and I kept telling him I dont have any healthy coping mechanisms and even if I do they arent working well enough.I can feel things just getting worse and part of me wants it to, so that maybe then I could say things like \"I'm cant get out of bed\" and not \"well Im fine now but Im on the verge of not being able to get out of bed and I feel like shit all the time\".  How do I get a professional to take me seriously? Is mindfulness the only option for stress management? Thanks.\n",
      "Right now, at this moment I'm feeling very stressed and afraid because a lot of things in my life recently have happened, and i have come to the point where people always scream at me, people always explode in anger when I don't agree with them on or when we are in a disagreement and lately this is happening to me so many times in so many different situations I'm beginning to feel insecure and really stressed and traumatized by the reoccurring situations. I just wanted to know your opinions on how should I deal with people that are very explosive very aggressive and how should I do with the idea that this will happen again and how can I deal with this, even when it's unavoidable.Thank you for taking your time to read this.\n",
      "This is the first time in my life I've had to deal with real stress.  I'm 17, and am leaving for a 5 month volunteer program in two days.  I have to fly across the country on my own, where I'll meet the group of strangers who I'll be spending the next five months with.  This on its own is very, very stressful.  I have social anxiety, and I'll have to leave my family (the longest I've been away from my parents is a week).But because I'm leaving in early January, this meant finishing all my classes early.  I barely studied over the winter break.  I did two tests today, which I think I did okay on.  But I have all my exams tomorrow, plus another test.  I'm screwed.  I've been trying to cram all the information I can into my brain, but I feel too fatigued and strained for any of it to even make sense.  And I just discovered a new unit of material in the study guide my teacher gave me, which I didn't even know existed until now.  And that'll be a big chunk of the EXAM tomorrow.  I'm bound to end up with a very poor grade, which is in biology, the path I want to pursue in university.  How the hell can I imagine getting into university if I can't even do okay in the high school class?I only identified the issue I've been struggling with as being stress a couple days ago.  I said before then “ugh I'm stressed out” and whatever, but I didn't know what that really meant until now.  It took a while for me to link the racing mind, insomnia, gastrointestinal troubles, racing heartbeat, restlessness, diffuse concentration, low cognitive performance, disorganization, forgetfulness, and low immune system as all stemming from the same issue until then.  I never would have thought these could possibly be related, until I looked up “symptoms of stress” out of curiosity.  Damn, every one was bang on.  Crazy.\n",
      "So these past 3 months I have ran up my credit card bill(s) by probably eating out too much, getting holiday gifts, spending a vacation out of town, etc. I initially calculated that it would be kinda tight when I would pay early February's credit card bill but I didn't realize I would be at least negative -$1,800 by the time February 3rd comes (credit card autopay day), and that's not even including less calculative costs such as food and gas costs this month! I have lost sleep since mid December just knowing it would be a tight financial start to the year but now I know I'm at a negative, I'm getting terrible stomach pains in the morning, just seeing bank ads makes me sick, etc.This past Sunday I told my partner we need to talk, and we are planning on talking today. I haven't told her the context of our meeting, that it's about money, because I didn't want her to dwell on it up until today. I'm really not looking forward to talking to her, like i'm legit sick to my stomach imagining how I'm gonna tell her that I have allowed us to be financially irresponsible these past 3 months. I have a game plan though, I'm planning on taking out 4 or 5k from my savings and putting it in my checking account to absorb the blow from my credit card bill but I still have this cloud of shame looming over my head. Additionally, I'm really stressed about the elephant in the room, which is that we are not really smart financially and we can't be making any more mistakes in the future. It's just baffling to me how fast money can go, like we are 170k combined income, and between student debt bills, and cost of living (bay area, around 1700k rent), all of this money goes away really quickly when you make a few bad calls outside of your monthly bills.I just don't know where to start, in terms of managing this stress.\n",
      " **Did you know that your brain cannot differentiate between imaginary and real stress?????!!?**Why am I so passionate about stress management and living stress-free life?In 2010, my mom was diagnosed with stage 4 breast cancer. I was terrified. I was 16, in school, with no idea if I would have a mom for my Senior graduation. Luckily, after having the cancerous cells removed, she was cancer free and has been cancer free ever since.After many tests, the doctor finally got to the cause of ma's cancer: STRESS 😖That's when I need I HAD TO do something about helping others reduce and eliminate stress from their lives. I couldn't bear the thought that mom could go on a stress roller-coaster again and I could lose her for it.I searched left and right for something that could really help her, for a set of skills, knowledge, whatever it was within the health field that could satisfy me professionally and could help others manage as well.Doctor? Nah, I'm an advocate of functional over traditional medicine.  Nurse? Nah, just wasn't the right fit for the lifestyle I wanted.  Life coach? Yeah, the tools were great when I got certified.

      "I just started the IB in my school and it's really stressful obviously and I thought I'd be okay but how wrong I was.I started getting these horrible stomach aches to the point where I missed 2 weeks of school because I could barely get out of my bed. My doctors gave me painkillers and did a few tests cause they had no idea what was wrong with me and in the end she and my therapist said it's most probably due to excessive stress. I also think it is because it stopped completely this winter break and started this Sunday night, the night before school started and now my constant pain is back.I'm very stressed and I'm trying to comfort myself and trying breathing and stuff but nothing works, I don't know what to do because it makes it hard to walk to school, sleep, and wake up in the morning.Please help me, it's been happening since the second week of September of last year and I don't think I can deal with school with this constant pain.\n",

      "Okay so as the title says can y'all define stress and anxiety. Also is anxiety related to being too curios everytime, thinking or daydreaming every now and then about something that you like. Basically I'm a 19 yo lean guy who just keeps dreaming in my own fantasy world...lol...and always be in the mood of being curious about certain things or just keep daydreaming whatever I like. Can this lead to stress ? Cause I've recently cought cold for over a month and have been getting a bit of stomach aches from about a bit more than a week, and also have been feeling as if my stomach is full and my digestion has slowed down. The doctor pointed out towards stress. I basically don't have any worries, hardly have any problems to think over, no fear about anything.

      "So two months ago I impulsively quit my last job--a remote phone-based tech support position. At the time I really felt like I was between a rock and a hard place, my anxiety was through the roof and it seemed like the best option. At first I felt way better, but predictably when the money ran out I started panicking. It was then that I realized that *every* job has \"made me stressed out,\" and to a degree the problem is how I handle the job. But I'm not sure how to improve that.Part of me feels like if I *don't* heap tons of pressure and stress on myself, I'll suck at the job. And there's a bit of that Protestant work ethic at play here--feeling like my performance at work is a direct indicator of my personal character, and if I even slip a little bit it's a sign of a huge flaw on my part.I'm starting a new job next week, ironically the exact same job I stress quit two months ago--just with a different company. Being away from it (and comparing it to the options I have otherwise) has made me realize it was a good job in a lot of ways, and I *was* competent at it--I just got stressed too easily. How can I keep from being a stressed, frazzled mess at work while still applying *enough* pressure on myself to be competent at my job?\n",

      "I'm a Production Coordinator in the film industry, which basically means I am constantly chasing deadlines. Screening deadlines, interdepartmental deadlines, daily client delivery deadlines. I work minimum 60 hours a week (no weekend work yet thank god,) and basically have no time for anything but sleep. I've been on this project for a year, and up until a week ago was coordinating 5 departments by myself (now down to 3 and regular show Prod duties). I just got through a particularly intense screening delivery and once it was over and the adrenaline wore off, I hit a wall. I finished work at 1.30am in the morning and was back at 9.30am that day. Since then, I have felt beyond exhausted, and basically cannot stop my face from leaking (aka crying). I left work early Friday because of how wrecked I was, my brain literally shut down and I could hardly think. My back and shoulders have been tense for months, to the point where some days I can hardly move because I'm so sore and tight. I've had a really relaxing weekend (massage, sleep, cooked healthy food, yoga, lots of self care,) but one stressful encounter with my housemate tonight left me tense and shaking for an hour. What else can I try  has worked for you? I do mindfulness, try to sleep as much as I can and have downtime, but I would love to hear some other people's perspectives and stress management techniques. I'm about 8 weeks out of this project ending and it's only going to get more intense. I love my job and I kick ass at it, but I also need to get through it without crying because I'm tired and stressed\n",

      "So a while ago, i meet this girl from FB Dating app, we started talking and when on a couple date. One day i decided to ask her to be my GF and she gladly said yes! So one day i went over to her house to spend time with her and she ask me to have sex with her and i agree to do it, and all i can say, she wasn't good at all. She kept putting her wrist  on my neck and was chocking me and i told her to stop. Afterwards, she got upset with me and told me to leave and said she didn't wanna speak to me anymore. Later that same night, i got a message on Facebook and she told me she was really sorry on how things went and i accepted her apology and started talking and hanging with her again. So today we was suppose to hang out at her office and go to the park afterwards to have lunch. So early this morning, i went to the store and brought snacks and things and when i got back home, i told her i was going to get there around 10:50, she wanted me there by 11. She told me to meet at her house and we'll walk to her office yesterday. So after i told her i was coming at 10:50 she started yelling at me over the phone for some reason and told me just come at 11:10 and i had no idea why she was so mad at me.. I just told her to message me when she was there. She message me and told me she wanted me there until 2, then she message me and told me that she wasn't there yet, than she told me she was waiting for people to leave. 30 minutes later, she told me forget it just don't come and stop answering the phone and replying to my messagesWhat should i do with her? She's really upsetting me\n",
      "Bi-weekly, we have our DnD game night and we have some friends who stay the night iver since they come in from out of town. Its not them its me. I know it is. The problem? I tend to freak out when we have things planned out that my hubby and I want to do but then I just.... I dunno I tend to snap more at my friends and hubby when I need to get things done so we can hang out with our friends longer.I don't want to tell them to leave for a bit and seem rude so we can get some things done and not worry about them. I feel like i would be, i know I'm being a bitch when I don't mean to be when I wanna get things tied up and do fun things. Example. Our washer went out last night when I was doing some laundry, our land lord is gonna fix it. Wet laundry is heavy and I didn't want to try walking pass five guys with a heavy, wet, basket of laundry. My car is usually blocked in the garage on these days, I don't mind since I can use my hubby's. I started to get upset and freak out a little because the basket was heavy and I didn't want to be a bother so I went out through the garage. My friends kept saying for an hour that they were gonna leave then they wanted to stay later which wasn't helping my panic of \"oh crap, i need to do this and this. I really need a shower cause i feel super gross and still need to do this and get this to my dad's to finish laundry and I have to either go back or stay there for this long.\" I don't know anymore, I know my behavior has pushed some friends away and they only hang out if I'm not there or of we show up to where their at. Maybe I just need to hole up somewhere so they can do all the fun stuff.\n",

      "I have been under a lot of stress for the past 1.5 years. I was able to keep myself productive enough at both work and home to the minimum levels required. However,  lately, it looks like I have given up. Things which are making me stressed are due to family problems which I don't know if they will ever be resolved. After that realization, I have not been able to involve in an activities which are otherwise interesting for me and am generally passionate about. I feel like I just let the day turn to night and stress about future until I am mentally tired enough to fall asleep. I think I can also feel stress in my upper body. The sensation which one gets on hearing a troubling news but like it is a constant.Any tricks I can use to get back to being productive and start doing things again?\n",
      "And now that it's the night before she keeps slamming her back door (which is right outside our window) 100 percent on purpose. I just turned the TV up and she started yelling. We're literally getting a restraining order because she threatened to blow up our house. For no fucking reason. Also it's my girlfriends birthday tomorrow so she has to go to court on her birthday (we live together next to the evil witch.)The amount of stress I have gone through because of this lady is INSANE. All because she has a drinking problem and loves to take out her problems on us because we are literally the closest ones within earshot. She's said she's frank Sinatra's god daughter. She's said she has friends in Hawaii and asked me how long I think it will take for them to get here. She yells about rats that may or may not go by outside in between our houses. But she's crazy so idk for sure. Plus rats are every city in the US. And my neighbor has said she puts food on the wall dividing our houses to feed the fucking rats. I just want to relax and be able to sleep. When this first started she was legitimately drunk screaming at us all night and day. Literally all night. Multiple nights in a row. She's seems like a normal old woman from a distance but she's the most evil old lady I've ever encountered let alone live next too! She was even arrested the night she threatened us. And it was originally a federal crime (criminal threats) but they say it is a misdemeanor now. Not sure why.Does anyone have any helpful advice? Would be much appreciated.\n",

      "I failed math. Yup. Atleast i tried. My math teacher, shouldnt be a teacher. The whole class dosent pay attention, i have problems paying attention in general, i forget things almost instantly. I would tell my parents but they dont beleive me. My math teacher dosent teach, she speaks so quitely and she only demonstrates. I have gone to 3 other math teachers for help. I re took a test, and i only got half a point back. I studied for that test and i knew that test. I jist didnt understand how to work that fancy fucking calculator. I asked for help and they couldnt give it to me. Whats the point of teaching it with a calculator, when we could do it all by hand years before. I can do it by hand, but i dont remeber how. I know i knew how to do it because i passed all my math classes years prior. I got notes from a diffrent math teacher, and they didnt help at all. My parents are pissed off, and im pissed off. They are always like, you can ask me for help, but they always tell me to go to someone diffrent. I have to do summer school now. I am very stressed, i am always working and in school and staying up late partying with friends. My buddy who dosent pay attention at all in math, (he plays on his phone the teacher dosent care) understands math better than me. I dont understand it. It actually makes me mad. Even when i do try and pay attention in math, i forget it instantly. Ive noticed that when i read math problems i will keep readinv them over and over and over becauzs i forget the number, or i forget to stop. I try to get extra math help, but i keep forgeting to.

      "I'll try and make this short. But in November I woke up in the middle of the night and passoutfainted I woke up min or so later got up to walk again and I fell  again and I was on my knees and I fainted pretty much again. I went to the hospital and they didn't know the cause they said it was likely low blood pressure and stress. I had blood work done and had a heart monitor on for 2 days all test came back fine. I later went to a different hospital I believe a week later and they did blood work a d a ECG all was fine. I am on a wait list for a MRI but it's been almost 3 months and yet to get a call for an appointment. But anyway I can't remember the last day I went thru that I did t have this Pain on the top of my head, right in the center. Sometimes it's really bad others it there just enough to let me know it's there. Also with this pain I feel light headed and sometimes dizzy. If I go upstairs I get dizzy if I shovel snow I feel like I'm gonna black out.Is this stress related. Like has anyone else had similar issues. I told a family member they said go see a Dr but I'm at the point where I don't see the point. Everytime I go they just don't know and say its stress.My first time to see the dr was in Oct 2019 again he said stress. Because I lost my house do to a fire. December was complete hell I lost 2 family members a week apart so I never went to the dr again because they wouldve just said the same.There is also other stress factors but not important ATM.So much for being short.

      "I think I'm ill. I've hate myself one way or another since I was at least 8. I've always failed to decide what I want to do. I am busy with several careers at the same time, and although I'm more successful than my contemporaries in both of them, but I feel like I have no idea what I'm doing and I'm not focused on a single vocation that I can excel at and help others with too. At the same time, I'm always wondering whether it would have been better to take another career path, because it seems I could have been a much more useful person if I could focus with a clear goal there. And those paths that I stress about are so many and so diverse.I'm always in a state of stress. It's killing me. I cannot enjoy my time, my rests, and the few vacations that I do take (although I'm very good at pretending to enjoy it). Since I cannot decide what to do, I browse youtube and reddit instead. I have a stack of books, all of which I would love to read, but when it comes to reading, I cannot decide which one to read and the stress pushes me back to reddit and youtube again. When i do finally decide to read one of the books, it'll take me less than a minute to lose my focus and stress about how maybe it would have been a better idea to read another books instead, and the circle of not knowing which book to read and retreating to youtube and reddit kicks in again.This cycle occurs in almost all parts of my life. That's why I feel that as a 29 year old, I'm losing my youth, the peak of my capability, to indecision and soon I'll be old and unable to achieve anything, a life that is lost.\n",
      "This is my first ever post on Reddit, so please excuse any mistakes.   I don't really know how to start this of. I go to an IB (International Baccalaureate) school. They are typically known for being extremely high demanding and performance driven, or at least mine is. Ever since the first day we started getting grades in school I have always loved getting good grades, being a high achieving student became  one of my main priorities in life. Living up to the expectations I had on myself has been the center of my life ever since then. For the most part have I really really enjoyed it. That rush and adrenaline kick I would get when receiving a test paper or the e-mail with the grade for an essay I have written. I lived for these \"highs \" I guess you could call them.Due to this I have always worked way above the pressure and expectations anyone should have on themselves. Meaning that anytime that I have gotten a B+ or anything below that would completely ruin me for days on end. Because of this stress has been something that I have tried to cope with for I don't know how long. Always expecting myself to perform above and beyond has in a sense taken a toll on me emotionally, physically and mentally. But even though this would I continue to push myself. Now that I look back at it while writing this I seem them almost as warning signs that my body gave me. But since a half year (possibly even longer) or so back has everything been declining. And by everything, I mean E.V.E.R.Y.T.H.I.N.G. I started lacking energy when sitting in class. I Began to isolate myself from friends and struggling to pay attention even when I was interested. My teachers have a tendency to ask students who are not paying attention if they are not only physically present but also mentally present. Which is really how I feel, my body is 100% in school  but my brain is somewhere in the clouds waiting for the torment which is called \"school\" to just be over. This has now become my everyday life. I went from a student which had plans and motivation to achieve something. To someone who hates to realize that any day that isn't a weekend or a day off, is just another day lost to to pure sadness and despise. I have started hating life, wanting to just disappear and escape all the work and expectations which seems to constantly chase me. What I am getting at is that I feel like there are these never ending expectations on me which I can't seem to satisfy no matter how hard I work.My life has become hell which seems to never end. Everyone has these expectation on how I am \"supposed\" to behave and on the level which I am \"supposed \" achieve. I feel like no one really understands what is happening to me and can help me understand myself. I just want to get back to how everything was before where I had motivation and plans.If you can relate or somehow live into the situation I currently feel like I am in. Please give me some advice I would be ever grateful. Thank you.\n",
      "Nobody knows this, but I'm the world's most insecure person. I also have some undiagnosed crippling compulsion issues, and anger issues which are currently doing better than they have for many years. Lazy as fuck too. But right now, insecurity makes them superficial.I'm a dude and I'm sixteen. I'm pretty insecure about my height, and one too-embarrassing-to-admit physical feature, but my intellectual ability is what I struggle with the most. You can clearly tell that I'm writing pretentiously, and the reason is that, being a teenager, it has engulfed my identity for years. I've passively assumed myself the greatest writer of all time since I was maybe about thirteen, because of a rather kind English teacher, and I always bitterly rejected the potential of any given piece to be beyond my capability. So it isn't great for me that now, every single time I muster the courage and willpower to put something out there, it will be met with scathing critiques and nothing to redeem.I do write out of vanity (artistically, not right now). There's rarely much passion behind what I come out with, and a few times people have been quite generous in review, but there just aren't that many reviewers. They always seem radically opposed to what I write, while the minority of supporters are so in apathy.I also fucking hate school, and I feel like a slave to it.\n",

      "It may seem like a no brainer for some and a surprise for others, but **stress** is highly associated with clutter. While living with **depression** can often increase the risk of clutter, studies have shown that the more clutter you are surround in, the more stressful an experience you will have. Living and working in a clean environment is a surefire way to begin eliminating stress from your life. Whether it's just tidying up more regularly or doing a major overhaul of your clutter, the moral of the story is the same. Less mess equals less **stress**. It can be frustrating for many to keep up on household tasks. This is especially true for people who live with others and have varying standards of **cleanliness**. A good way to address this issue is to assign those you live with specific tasks that you can work on so that the **stress** of cleaning up after others is eliminated as well as the messes themselves. If you find that you are struggling with people who don't want to help you keep your environment clean, sometimes the best way to handle it is to take responsibility for yourself and yourself only. Clean your own dishes, do your own laundry, and claim a space for yourself that you can easily maintain without the interference of others. This will help you to wash your hands of a problem that can sometimes seem to have no solution. If you find it difficult to keep up on household duties and maintaining a clutter free environment, don't worry. You're not alone. You could very easily begin to improve. Take small steps at first in putting a system in place that you can maintain. If things are bad, start one room at a time until completion and have a plan ready to keep it maintained. Set rules for yourself using charts and planners and alarm reminders so you know that on a certain day you will be dusting and doing regular household upkeep.Once everything is deep cleaned, then maintaining that standard can be as little as ten minutes per day if you break it up into a routine. Then once a month you can begin to do a deep clean so it gets easier and easier to stay on top of the clutter. Everything can benefit from having a good system in place. This can be especially true for motivated and busy people. If you are having a hard time juggling your responsibilities and tend to put cleaning at the bottom of the list, you're not alone. However, it would significantly reduce the **stress** that you are experiencing if you move cleaning up on your list of priorities and develop a regular schedule for your daily routine that includes making sure that the spaces where you spend the most time are as clean as possible!\n",
      "I'm 15 right now, school is becoming so hard, I've got to the point where I'm so stressed that I just spend all my time thinking about my work instead of actually doing it.For the next 3 weeks, I've got a big important test each day. They're not even exams, just big tests.I told myself that I would start studying yesterday: i came home, opened my agenda and started crying, it was big, ungly, loud sobs. I'm so stressed, I basically had a mental breakdown over school, and this isnt even the hardest year. One of the only ways I deal w stress is cutting myself, so that occupied me for a while. People always say put ur mental health before school work, but for me, a lazy perfectionist, that makes my mental health worse.I'm so tired because by the time I've finished crying about how much work I have, I'm completely drained and I fall asleep. I then wake up when my parents come home so 8PM, have dinner and then start my school work. I'm usually still up at 1-2 AM. Then I wake up at 7 and start again. AND MY TEACHERS THEN GIVE US MORE FUCKING WORK CUZ U KNOW, 1 MENTAL BREAKDOWN A WEEK ISNT ENOUGH!!!!I cant fucking deal w this anymore but if I give up on school then I'll be even more stressed if such a thing is possible\n"

On top of that I had begun seeing this guy. Everything seemed to be going great. I was enjoying dating. I decided one night after a couple glasses of wine and motivation from my best friend to sneak into his room and spend the night (he's my best friend's brother). I had no intention but to cuddle and sleep because he had to be up early and it was already pretty late. Well things ended up getting physical. (Shoulda slept in the guest room?) We had sex. It was quick. The next morning I could tell the dynamic was different. Not just, hey we had sex and it was great. But instead, hey this feels weird. I drove him to school. He barely kissed me and then I reaaaally knew something was up. Cut to yesterday, he tells me he's dealing with some mental health stuff and as much as he likes me and thinks I'm great is unable to be in a relationship or continue this at the moment. He explained some valid points of things I knew he was struggling with previously. But man, as someone who has been around mental health her entire life and even struggles herself, this was difficult to hear.

Happy new year everyone. We made it and maybe things will get better.\n",
      "I don't know about anyone else, but I'm a little bit worried that I'll go back to being depressed in a few days time or something. Last year, I tried not to have any breakdowns for the start of 2019. A mere 10 days later, I broke down crying. I wasn't the same for that entire year. Up until December, where I was ok that month. Now I just wait... it's a weird way to act and feel, but it feels a bit normal.\n",

      "It's actually funny. I used to end every previous year with \"Okay, that was bad, but surely it can't get much worse!! You can only go up from rock bottom!1!!11!\", only to get fucked in the most unimaginable ways by the next year, to the point where I've mostly dissociated from my own existence and it's nothing more than a bad fucking movie. I absolutely can't wait to see how the shit hits the fan again in 2020. The new endlessly creative ways fate comes up with to fuck me up never cease to amaze me, and life has yet to fail in exceeding my expectations! So what will it be this time? Homelessness? Another chronic illness? Or perhaps my family finally disowns me? Stay tuned!\n",
      "I'm very easily agitated because if my depression, which doesn't really affect me except for with my family. I'm not annoyed at my friends, they could do almost everything, but if my family even looks at me the wrong way it sets me off. My usual reaction is to just go to my room, to avoid conflict (because my parents always get really mad when I'm annoyed), which might make them even more mad, because they ‘don't see me as much as they used to'. Basically I can't do it right in this situation, because if I avoid it they get mad and if I don't avoid it they also get mad, and their solution is to just ‘not be annoyed as much', which really can't be done. On new years eve (of all eves) my dad (again) got really mad at me. Threatened to throw me out of the house we're currently in and spent the night outside (we're on a ski vacation, it get's below -15°C here at night). Said I have to go to therapy for being annoyed (I've went to therapy before, it really did not work for me). My mother joined in and asked why I couldn't just be a normal child. So yeah, I spend the first few hours of this new decade crying.\n",
      "I can say with certainty that I have tried hard to make my life one worth living but my ongoing depression is more present and crippling than ever recently.I would never do anything while my mum is still alive because I know she wouldn't cope. I'm her only daughter and we are very close. But I'm clueless as to how to live with this fog that has followed me since my teenage years, especially if I don't have her in my life.It's as if the depression becomes heavier the older I get, despite the sertraline and hours and hours of therapy. I just can't see myself living a long and fulfilled life.\n",
      "Seemed like the right evening for this poem. Depression is so hard and so horrible. It is sometimes impossible to find a glimmer, but if you can, whatever it is, grab it. Day by day, you're not alone. Remember you're a good person. Things can get better. There's a spark in you somewhere. Dig it out, whatever it takes, there are no rules. Respect to you all for the new year. *You have to be always drunk. That's all there is to it--it's the*   *only way. So as not to feel the horrible burden of time that breaks*   *your back and bends you to the earth, you have to be continually*   *drunk.*   *But on what?Wine, poetry or virtue, as you wish. But be*   *drunk.*   *And if sometimes, on the steps of a palace or the green grass of*   *a ditch, in the mournful solitude of your room, you wake again,*   *drunkenness already diminishing or gone, ask the wind, the wave,*   *the star, the bird, the clock, everything that is flying, everything*   *that is groaning, everything that is rolling, everything that is*   *singing, everything that is speaking. . .ask what time it is and*   *wind, wave, star, bird, clock will answer you:\"It is time to be*   *drunk! So as not to be the martyred slaves of time, be drunk, be*  *continually drunk! On wine, on poetry or on virtue as you wish.\"*                             [Charles Baudelaire](https:www.poemhunter.comcharles-baudelairepoems)\n",
      "Left abusive relationship. Moved in with abusive family. Put on disability in April. Constant health issues and drs and labs with no answers except maybe slight b12 deficiency, no immunity to mumps (just got the booster yesterday), pt for two different pains, chiropractor 3x a week. Passed out twice in a week due to weight loss. Was 137 last year and down to 88 can't gain weight to save my life. Wake up every morning in constant pain and nausea making it hard to eat and have energy. Stopped talking to my father's side of the family due to the mental abuse but still pressured by my mom to fix things before my grandmother gets old and passes away. Fiance lost his job in September and hasn't been able to get another even with dropped charges. Lost our first pregnancy the same week. Struggled to get through first semester of medical billing classes online. Maxed out credit cards to pay rent and utilities. Can't pay cc bills piling up and medical bills in collections. Spent a quiet Christmas together that turned to hell the day after when we had to put one of our cats to sleep due to heart failure which was traumatic to see and decide to end his suffering after two different vet offices. Almost ruined relatioship with mom, she was on vacation and I felt like she needed to be aware of it because he was supposed to go to her next year. Can't afford pain meds or anything at this point. My car is paid off but dead and needs work we can't afford. Just not sure if I can deal with this anymore. Lease is up at the end of March and we can't afford staying here rn but can't afford another deposit anywhere else. No family in Fl to stay with and can't afford relocation even if offered a job out of state. Trying to sell everything I own for as little as possible to get rid of the physical and emotional baggage and to pay rent, utilities, other debts. Pretty much exhausted everything and just wondering if this is the end of line for us. I'm scared of ended up homeless and losing our pets, they are the only thing we have rn really the only thing that gets me out of bed everyday to take care of them and love them with what little I have left in me. Losing my boy after Christmas broke me completely and I just don't think next year or next decade is worth suffering through. I don't want to deal with more doctors that won't find anything because most of it is probably stress related and they can't do anything about that. I don't know if it's worth starting the classes I signed up for if we end up homeless and without a way for me to take my online classes. I just don't know. I'm scared and tired and can't continue living life this way. Every day feels like living hell. My body is absolutely useless and I hate it. I'm useless to everyone including myself and more of a burden than anything...this isn't living its just suffering.\n",

      "My father died in the beginning of December. While he was not a great father he was the only person I felt I could even talk to. I was extremely upset but later on found out that he apparently never told his own brother that we existed. Everyday I am either angry or upset. I feel so alone and being around my mother is worse who constantly talks over me or criticizes me. There is nothing positive in my life at the moment. The only thing that keeps me going is my dog or reading.\n",

      "In any order, I watch youtube, then when I'm tired of it, I look at animes, then I need to look at some mangas. When I'm bored of watching things, I play video games. When I'm done with those things, I take a look at people's opinions in different posts like Reddit while listening to some dumb music that vibes with my nostalgic, mystic feelings.  And the cycle continues. Rare occasions, I try to do something more meaningful like learning a language, or drawing, or learn the piano, or take a walk, or something. But it doesn't last, even if I want to. Somehow, I feel hatred to continue with this productive procedure.I don't find much pleasure in those things because I always have that feeling of emptiness. This emptiness or hopelessness makes me quit school, my job and some random activities. Anger, sadness, jealousy and emptiness became my being. But I still have my kind soul, I would like to think. I thought I could have become emotionally dead to counter my depressed state. But It didn't work. But it did help a little with my anxiety and to confront a situation. I guess, now I'll try to find a way to get this feeling of satisfaction to live through my life which I'm really disappointed with.These addictive habits to escape life don't work anymore. I feel like if I don't do something about it, my future is death by my own hands without hesitation.  I'll try to once again to change my addictive habits and my hopeless point of view. I know it may take some years to do so, I even hope a few months can make me change drastically. But, I'll try... I'll try starting tomorrow... I hope tomorrow me helps himself and be consistent...\n",

      "I'm 23 and I've been depressed since I was at least 11 years old. I've struggled making friends pretty much my entire life (except for when I was young and basically everyone was friends with everyone else). I've been on suicide watch for over a week twice in the last 10 years and attempted suicide nearly successfully in September. Things in my personal life have been absolute hell for the last year and a half and since starting my new career (which is freelance and work-from-home) I'm more lonely and isolated than ever. I have friends, but they all have friends they're closer to andor friend groups that I'm not apart of, which really makes me feel like I have no friends at all. Seeing everyone celebrate the joy in the last 10 years of their lives is making me feel like an absolute failure at life itself. My social skills have developed tremendously in the last 3 years but essentially having no friends right now is really killing me inside. I want to be able to reflect on everything that's happened in the past 10 years (especially the last two) for the purposes of personal growth but all I feel is pain inside for everything that's happened, the opportunities I've missed, and the feeling that I'm wasting my life away being constantly depressed. I don't know what's going to become of me if things don't get better really, really soon.\n",
      "I felt miserable and still do so I thought, hey, why not do what my dad always does and drown my sorrows with alcohol? He got me a bottle of Irish cream the other night just to be nice. I had mentioned wanting to make a recipe with it sometime so he got me some to try. But today I'm just feeling horrid. It's gonna be a new year and I'm sure it'll be just as worthless as this year. So I decided to down like half the bottle. It's a small one, but I never drink, so a few minutes later I was feeling dizzy and still I am. I don't even care. I would probably down the whole bottle if it wouldn't make my dad suspicious. Cause you know he's allowed to have bad habits but I'm not. Everyone is. On the bright side I'll probably sleep well tonight.\n",

We talk often for a few weeks. Then they just disappear. They move away. I guess it is my fault that I am annoying. I just don't see a reason to fight with life anymore. No one cares. I think Imma just end it. I can't take going to school, not talking to anyone then coming back home, unmotivated to do anything, just watching pointless videos and daydreaming about stuff that's never going to happen. I miss the times when I told people that I had no friends, but I actually had people who cared about me. Now what I once said is actual reality. I miss being able to share my thoughts with someone. It somehow gave me the drive to battle the things life threw at me. I guess life just doesn't want me. I don't have much time left. I guess I will just try not to annoy people until it is time. Eh...\n",

Can I just delete myself as I tried three times already? There's sadness, there's a family I care of and honestly, that's one of the main thoughts that keeps me alive. The sadness I always lived with came back doubled in strength, with the notes that describe my end, with the ironic smile I can provide.And here I am, writing those notes, my thoughts that are coming out faster I can analyze, there's the world I lost but wanted to, there are people I care about that just can't anymore. If people still care then those people are carrying my pain and they're the only the family I have. Only people I still can write a message to. Please give me the rest, out of the pain I was feeling those years, countless pills that only hide the pain, the suicide I can relate to, I'm feeling my wines, my brain, my head, my emotions.I wish I could get rid of the emotions and just live the life as it is, but learned already I cannot. The pain was always coming back and ot's now with me, as it was before. It's kinda soft and comfortable, knowing the time is coming, the person you care you if seeing other stars.

I wasn't planning on using the bullets anytime soon cuz I don't have a gun, but I was very quickly dissuaded and I didn't feel like doing it anymore. Now it's close to 2020 where New Years is gonna be lonely and Valentine's day is gonna be the damn worst, not only is it the day to appreciate love and I'm probably one of the most lonely bastards to be alive right now, but it's my birthday. I'm gonna start off 2020 with the worst luck and I'm sure there are other people out there that have worse and I'm sorry, I just needed to rant cuz I just feel I have no one to talk to.

My girlfriend gave me something to look forward too and not only did she give me a loving relationship but she gave me my bestfriend. I know how selfish and clingy I am for feeling this way and I'm ashamed to admit to it but it's true. If my future is going to be spent alone with my thoughts then I'm not sure if I want a future. I'm overall not really happy with life I put a smile on my face and try to make everyone else around me as happy as I can but unfortunately it doesn't make me happy and fulfilled like I hoped. I really just want to be with the person I love because that's the only thing I look forward and again knowing I won't be able to do that doesn't give me much drive to really carry on.I wish I could tell her and apologize for being the way I am but I know if I did she'd probably leave me or be too scared to pursue her dreams and while my thoughts are selfish I'm not selfish enough to get in the way of someone's aspirations.\n",

      "Just gone over 4 years of depression. I say that like I have been diagnosed but I am yet to go seek help. So I guess let me rephrase it as 4 years of an internal struggle. It's started way back in late 2015 when I started to feel this kinda change in me like nothing or no one interested me anymore. I am aware I should seek the necessary help but my life is just a little too complicated for that. For starters there is my family I cannot begin to imagine how I would even start a conversation about this. Then there is my mum who is just my world. She is a deeply pious women and I recall a vivid conversation we had about mental illness and do you know what she told me she said there is no where in the holy book ( I won't say which cause it's not that important) that has anything on mental illness you tilt only 2 ways you're crazy or you're stressed. I remember feeling unsettled by this as I try to understand her but ultimately it broke my heart because I came to the realisation she could never understand the complexity of mental illness. So I stayed quite for years and I guess I have been staying quite ever since and buried it within me. But I am currently feeling the worst I have ever felt in my life and I don't know I don't want to feel alone anymore. Sorry for waffling but I wanted to ask how does someone blurt this out??\n",

I never really get dressed up or try to look girly —mostly I try to spend time on my writing— and I've just been reminded why. “I'm gonna be at this club with a lot of hot girls and I want my girlfriend to look as good as possible, sorry but you don't look good in that dress. Not with that big mole on your back. Some people just aren't meant to wear dresses. It's not me that made it this way, it's just the way the world works” - my boyfriend Funny how no one ever told me that before in all my 23 years. But I guess it takes some people time to learn how the world works. I have changed into a t shirt and jeans.I'm not sure why I posted this, maybe for pity, maybe for you to tell me I'm disgusting. Honestly either works. He suggested I sell all my dresses on eBay to pay for a mole removal but they apparently cost like $800 and they can grow back. So I don't really even want to bother.\n",
      "I have a chronic pain condition. That I keep hidden. Because no one understands it. No one gets what it's like to live every single day in terrible pain. All day. There's not a single memory I have where I wasn't in some amount of physical pain.And then doctors try to say it's a symptom of depression. Wouldn't it make more sense that I'm depressed because I'm constantly on physical pain - not the other way around?The only reason I keep going is to enjoy nature. It used to be nature and my friends. But my friends, well...one is being a giant asshole, ones not speaking to me...the others I keep at an arm's length...I just needed my best friend to tell me he was sorry I don't feel well today. It's the worst pain I've ever been in in my life. I feel so horrible, I thought maybe it's meningitis. I have a fever and a headache and my whole body feels like it's burning from my bones to my skin. It's like I'm full of crushed glass. Like gout, but everywhere. I woke up and I cried and I begged for god to kill me. And his response was, “If I get sick again, I'm gonna be so fucking pissed.”All I needed was care.No one really cares.Why do I continue to live in agony to spare these people's feelings? And nature is dying. Why do I continue to live to watch the thing I love most die?Because I'm a coward. And I want to die painlessly and quickly. And I don't know how.Please. It doesn't seem fair that I have to live. I live everyday in horrible pain. Please, god. Please just let me die.\n",
      "Christmas Evemorning I laid awake trying to find a reason to be alive. I couldn't find a single reason and was incredibly scared. In that moment I decided I didn't want to be alive. So I went and had a cup of coffee at a Waffle House so that I wasn't alone. I don't think I would have done anything, but I was so scared I couldn't be alone with myself.I've talked to some friends about it and calmed down, but I think I finally need to stop putting off seeking help for my depression. I don't want to be in that place again. What is the process I need to take to get therapy. I want to be better.\n",

      "I felt so positice today. Looking forward to the new year. Now I'm on the toilet with anxiety and diarrhea because my mom causes me so much stress. I was hoping tonight would go well too. I went to my fiancees house to visit with his mom and dad for a few hours. I told my mom I would be home by 8. I talked to her on the phone while I was there and told her more like 730. Honestly I had forgotten about that and left at 8. Before I even got out of the cul-de-sac she's blasting my phone with a call, yelling at me, \" where are you it's after 8!\" While it is literally 8:03 mind you. When we get to my house I break down crying. She tells me the usual. I'm sorry, I love you, I didn't mean to make you cry.\" I try to explain that just because you stab someone doesn't mean you want them dead. It's the same logic. She says then that what about the times when I do things to her and she has to accept my apologies? Like, I'm your fucking daughter, wtf. Anyway I'm just so fed up with everyone. I feel so depressed when I'm home. When I'm with my fiancee I feel better. And honestly, I feel like I have diarrhea from all this stress. Fuck this.\n",

Why am I such a poor loser?? My destiny?  I feel cursed. I was never Christened.  BUT this is the year I END the struggle and tears.  I'm done waiting for 'brighter days' or a 'stroke of good luck'.  Never happens.....I just lose more and more as the years go by.  I've now lost my family.  Not that I ever had them - I got moved to Canada from UK at 3.5....and moved 35 times since.  Watching the world move ahead of me financially....I'm just a spectator - despite working as hard, if not HARDER than most to 'better my life'. I give up.

So are there telltale signs that one may be entering a downward spiral, and are there ways to lessen the episode and not dig a deeper hole. Thank you.\n",
      "It's been a tough year for me and even tougher last week going into the new year. Being the end of a decade makes it even worse. But Jan 1st is just like any other day. If you're not feeling the way you want to or in a position that you wanted to be in by this time, don't worry. You have many more months ahead of you to better yourself. Don't be so hard on yourself and self evaluate to the point where you put yourself down. Be easy on yourself. I am sure there's plenty of things you did that you're proud of. Just gotta think hard on it and not let the negativity cloud your mind. I hope for a better year for myself and I hope 2020 is a great year for everyone. Stay safe and take care.\n",
      "So I don't know how to start things like this, So I'll start with basics. I'm 16yo, diagnosed depression at 14yo. Since then, my life is total mess. I've already been to two different psychologists, both of them said that i'm kind of unfixable, but that might be due to my young age. Why People that are supposed to help me, say things like that?! Since start of 2019, my life got even worse. My family, on outside, caring and loving, but inside, unthoughtful. All of my friends are fake, all of them try to take adventage of my current problems. I had a gf, she was really cute and loving, but she started ignoring me since christmas, today she broke up with me. My classmates don't care about me, and some of them wish me death. You might think, \"well, it isn't that bad, deal with it kid\", but thats really hard for me. My parents think that it's all fake, also they said that i Just do it, because i want some attencion. After my 1st suicide attempt, they said that I've gone too far with my \"Attention whore\" attitude. I've already had 6 suicide attempts, all of them ended up with getting yelled at by family and friends. Nobody really cared that i would Be gone, they were more afraid of going to court to give some reasons why i would do that, than me being dead. Also they said that it would bring them bad reputation. I'm feeling worthless, useless and i think that World would Be much better place without me... Now I'm Just a crying mess without any support and without any will to live.If you survived this story, thank you. I Just need to write about it, maybe it Will help me a bit.(Sorry for my bad English, I'm still learning)\n",
      "There is a deep feeling of sadness that seems to possess my mind and body every now and again. I have this one vivid memory from when I was about 7 years old. I lived with both of my parent in an old apartment on the third floor. I sat on the arm rest of the couch in my living room and stared out the window at rickety old cars passing on the street, at the corner of my eye I spotted an old man smoking a cigarette. He had dirty grey jeans, a black shirt with holes, and shoulder length hair tucked into a winter hat. It had to have been about 80 degrees on a hot summer day. Thinking back on this he could have very well just been a hipster, but let's just go with my 7 year old perspective and say he was indeed homeless. As I watched him slowly walk by I imagined myself leaving my body and seeing life through his eyes. The longer I stared the stronger it became, I imagined the feeling of every step he took on the hot cement and the smell of burning tobacco, I felt the confusion and desperation he must have felt every night while he searched for a safe place to sleep. I began to break down into tears and feel ashamed for having a place to sleep, and food in my refrigerator. I felt as though I didn't deserve the things that I had because others were more deserving. I remember not eating for the rest of the day because I felt so guilty for just being alive, which is absolutely ridiculous at the age of SEVEN. I still have these feelings a few times a week, they're so strong and take control of my mind. They make me feel weak and tired. I feel undeserving and invisible most days. I've given away money and belongings. I've even gone so far as to let people use me emotionally and sexually just to make them happy. This story escalated quickly. I don't know what kind of response I'm looking for with this post, I'm more writing my thoughts out. Thanks for reading\n",

      "I'm dying so hard and so far I can't even filter my exhaustion from others. I have no sense of purpose, I feel broken inside, and completely out of options. I wish I could explain the full feeling, but it's too complicated and out of my ability to write or speak. Well, I feel like I could write it out, but every time I do that it gets so long nobody can read it, even I wont.I'm still hurting from childhood, I'm still hurting from when my parents kicked me out on my 18th birthday at the absolute worst mental state I had ever been, I'm still hurting from the addictions I had, the homelessness I had, the brain damage I received from multiple suicide attempts, I'm still hurting from someone I met online and fell in love with and broke up with. I'm still full of interests I have considerable mental real estate dedicated to. But no passion for any of it, no love, no purpose. I'm 23 and not horribly ugly or an asshole, but I wont date anyone, never ask anyone out because the pain is too much, I can't function as a normal person like that. And that really tears me up because my capacity to love feels like it's only gotten larger. A part of my brain tells me to just become a drifter, and to be decent at it from a mix of what little bit of smart and wise I have mixed with nihlism. I sometimes fantasize about becoming a monk of sorts, or a self sustaining hermit somewhere remote, or to just hitchhike endlessly not caring about my health. But another part is telling me to live in this society that's fucked up but to try find an equal love and build life with eachother. I'm split, and even those two different things may not be the way for me either. It doesn't help I have very negative views on society, and I end up being too cynical, and nihilistic. I never try hard enough in anything I do. My fucking insides hurt. My heart feels like it's been broken my whole life and it just keeps progressing to levels of numbing yet deeply soaking pain into my soul, and it just keeps going beyond what I thought was possible for pain. I swear my brain is fucked up since birth, I wish there was anyway, because I honestly, honestly have never felt any amount of happiness or love. If I ever felt those, it was when I was too young to remember. I've never felt the love, I've only had partial broken feelings of slight content to take respite in.I'm either going to do something fucking crazy and alienate myself from everyone in my life again, or kill myself. I don't even want to fucking kill myself but fuck man, life is just too exhausting for absolutely not even a single fucking second of reward, or just feeling okay. Why can't I just feel okay??? I want to feel okayNobody knows who I am inside. Those that get close, I have to shut out because the pain is too much for them to see, and they would leave anyway, which would be the end of me\n",

      "Hello my son is almost one years old. My wife is a stay at home mom. Before she was pregnant she stayed at home as well and had free time to do whatever she wanted (art, YouTube, makeup). She has always struggled with socialgeneralized anxiety but was pretty good at self medicating and once a stressful situation was over with she would be good for a while. While she was pregnant her anxiety was actually really good and even months after giving birth it was good. Recently in the last 4-6 months(6-8months after giving birth) she has slowly gotten worse.  She is sad all the time, anxious, has panic attacks, etc. She is very self aware of her feelings and actions. Her family has a history of mental health issues. She has expressed that she does not want to see a therapist because she knows what she has and doesn't want to be medicated for it. A couple weeks ago I came home from work because she called me having a panic attack and said “I'm not good enough for our son, I can't do anything right “ or something along those lines. She has told me things I can do to help and I've tried to the best of my ability and yet she still says I'm not helping. She just said today that “ I don't know how bad it is”. I said tell me and she said “I'm sad everyday and frustrated and I'm the worst thing for our son”. I told her that I don't know how to help her and she said she doesn't know how to help herself. I know she would never hurt her self or our son so I'm not worried about that I just want advice on what I can do or some insight into whathow she is feeling and why. Our sons birth was not easy.  Born by c-section after 3 days of inducing and he spent a week in the NICU and my wife was in the hospital for a week too for high blood pressure( due to anxiety which hospitals don't understand). TLDR: Wife possibly has postpardom anxiety andor depression. Doesn't want clinical help and I don't know what to do despite trying to do what she has asked.\n",
      "I've (19F) been talking to someone (25M) for a few weeks and really like him and wanted to commit kind of soon.  We'd expressed how we both struggle with anxiety and depression. But I'd say I'm more of an anxious person at times not someone who has anxiety. And I'm more of a quiet sufferer of my depression.  So I figured that we'd be able to handle each other's anxiety because we know what it feels like. Then I realized how bad his anxiety was. I've never experienced it and honestly don't know how to go about it. Having anxiety is not a deal breaker! At all! I am just a little less willing to commit right now because I don't know how capable I am of being a good partner to him. Because I know there will be times where his anxiety takes over and it will make me feel like He doesn't trust or believe what I say. So I guess my question is are some of you guys in relationships? How do you navigate your relationship having a severe form of anxiety? What are some tips for me? How could I prepare to be a better partner so that when he is going through anxiety I'm not making it worse or making him feel unsupported?\n",
      "While I was parked outside waiting I noticed my heart was RACING and I know I get too focused on heart related stuff but after about 10 minutes of it I remembered that it is mental that is causing the physical, which helped me calm down. I was just wondering does anyone else have anxiety this bad? I mean if you think about it I was just waiting to see an old friend, yet my heart was BOOM BOOM BOOM BOOM. I know I'm overthinking it and giving it too much of my attention..I just want to feel less alone. This was a girl that I was friends with before I developed anxiety, and all of the problems I have today. My first girlfriend. I jest couldn't stop thinking that my life could have went so much better. I could have had more meaningful friendships, more connections with my old friends, instead of losing contact with everyone.\n",
      "He wants to take me to olive garden but I cant public. I feel like I'm ruining his new years. He seems visibly disappointed that I said I couldn't.I really just can't.I can stand people watching me eat.And I really hate saying my own order and he never does it for me because he thinks hes helping me. Idk just tell me something\n",
      "Hi! I'm hiding from my family in another room trying to do deep breaths and stuff but I don't know if it's working?Uh, so, I recently discovered that a bunch of my friends went out on new year's without me, doing a thing I always did with them, and haven't even told me about it. Of course, being the way that I am, I've assumed that they'll never care about me again, they're replacing me, etc, and I'm doing what my therapist calls spiraling! And the level of Fear in my heart is increasing rapidly, I can't breathe, all that fun stuff is occurring. According to all the research I've done, what I'm going through right now is a panic attack or anxiety attack (can't remember which is which)I'm in need of someone to talk to, or just, like, anything. I want to get through this. I want friends and I want to get out of my own head and I want to talk to people and aaaaaaThank you for coming to my TED talk!"

I just can't help but think of how much this isn't what I want for my life, but I just can't seem to change anything because I'm in a constantly escalating loop of depression and anxiety. Then I think of how I must just be lazy and faking it so I don't have to be a functioning adult because everyone else seems to deal with their shit just fine, so there's no reason why I shouldn't be able to as well. I feel like everyone took a class in high school on functioning in society and I was out sick that day or something, and there's no retakes ever. So basically I lay in bed and worry about everything and I feel like nothing will ever get better for me and I'm a big disappointment, and I have no one to talk to or who seems to understand what I'm trying to express, and I'm just so impotently frustrated at it all. Sorry about the venting here, I don't know why I'm even posting.\n",
      "Then get over it by the next morning. Anybody else?\n",
      "For background, I usually don't wear a lot of makeup. Most days it's only foundation and mascara, and MAYBE concealer, MAYBE. But since it's a holiday and my sister wants to go out and celebrate, I decided I would do a little bit more. Mostly bc I saw a girl on tik tok look really fucking pretty and immediately was struck with inspiration. Here's where the problem is, we have a few people meeting us out tonight. One is someone I used to have feelings for but she has a gf, who is coming. About an hour after I did my makeup my brain was like “Hey, you know that last time you saw *her gfs name* she was wearing eyeliner. What if she knows you liked her and thinks you still do and you're trying to imitate her gf in order to get her attention?” And just like that I want to take everything off and just go as I normally do, but I also know that's just my severe anxiety. I should be able to wear e y e l i n e r and not be self conscious about it. I'm fucking sick of this. I haven't even left my house yet and I want to go home.\n",
      "First off, I hope you have a Happy New Year. So here goes my story, One day I had a random panic attack and I haven't been the same since. I started feeling like I have every sort of serious medical problem as soon as I turned 14. Then, I started seeing my doctor and he had checked me out, I WAS HEALTHY. One day walking home I  had a sudden fast heart rate and almost passed out. I ran home and we called 911. I had an appoitment with a cardiologist, and I was diagnosed with S.V.T ( not life-threatening and easily cured through very simple surgery). But that didn't reassure me for long, after a week I started having anxiety with my heart. Now every fucking day of my life I feel like I will have a heart attack. If my heart feels fine, a simple stomach ace makes me feel like I have every major illness in the world. My life has become torture. I have been diagnosed with Illness Anxiety Disorder. But even that doesn't reassure me cause my symptoms feel real. Like how can it be in my head if I feel a problem? Anyways, I had my parents that I could talk to because I didn't want to tell my friends afraid of them seeing me as a freak or something like that. But now they just get mad at me when I ask for simple reassurance. They now have turned my issue into a punishment. They will say stuff like \"I won't get you that until you feel better\", and they will also say stuff like \"just stop thinking about it\" equivalent of telling a depressed person to \"stop being sad,\" I don't want to be seen as a typical depressed 14yr old because this is a major issue with me. Also, my therapist is of no help. She tells me basic shit like oh count the lights in your room when you feel scared. I just want answers from people who may have experienced this. I want to know if it is possible to get better. Please, I am desperate. Like I said my parents are no help. And I don't want to ruin my image in front of my friends (and I do have good friends), I just feel like they won't see me as the same person. And also sorry if this has grammatical errors cause this is my 3rd time writing this.\n",
      "It might be just me, but texting people gives me probably the most anxiety of anything. It's honestly worse than interacting with people when I can hear their voice, whether it's a call, facetime or in person. Just wanted to know if anyone feels the same way.\n",
      "The love of my life has been diagnosed with moderate anxiety not long ago.  For the most part, she is highly functional and does well and does not take any medication.  She occasionally suffers from panic attacks, feelings of being overwhelmed, or extreme guilt.  However what concerns me is that once in a blue moon, when she is faced with a difficult situation, she gets so overwhelmed and says she feels like she “wants to die” and that her brain “hurts so much” from being overwhelmed.   I can only imagine the struggle and I try to relate as much as I can.  It alarms me when she uses the term “wants to die” and I have her clarify if that means she is suicidal.  She always assured me that no, she doesn't want to kill herself, and that her thought process is just that it seems easier to just want to fade away or be dead than have to face the realities of being overwhelmed.   Can anyone relate to this and help me understand better?  Any advice is helpful on what I can do to help her when we are faced with this situation again.  She does assure me that she doesn't want to kill herself, but I worry.  And I want to help ease whatever she is going through.  I love her too much and like with any Larson you love, you go through the pain with them.  Thanks in advance!\n",
      "Me ; my bf got into a huge fight because I'm not going to his house for NYE. I tried to pretend I wasn't feeling well so I could have an excuse to stay home but he called me out ; told me if I didn't want to go to just tell him. I figured I could tell him the truth and he would understand but he definitely did not understand. I told him that my anxiety gets really bad when I go to his house because he always leaves me and sits across the room while he's on his phone and I have to sit there awkwardly trying to think of things to talk about with his family, his sister particularly. His sister ; I have nothing in common and she's 3 years older than me and I feel like she's constantly judging me. My bf doesn't understand that with social anxiety it's like a job to be around so many people and at the end of it all I feel so emotionally drained. He's so pissed at me right now that he yelled “happy new year” and hung up on me. Idk if this is the end of us but what I do know is I'm going to be spending NYE alone in my room,  but honestly I'd rather do this than be at his house right now. I wish he would understand how I felt. Well, thanks everyone for reading this and I hope you all have a very happy new year!\n",
      "I just got a new doctor recently and finally brought up my anxiety issues with her. It's been particularly bad the last two months due to stress and life changes. She was understanding, and thought it would be a good idea to try because it might help my GI issues I had been having. She told me she could prescribe me 10mg of lexapro to see if it worked for me. I told her to start me at 5mg instead and then we could work my way up later if needed. I was excited at first but now I'm a bit nervous to take it.I want to feel better and find a solution to my overthinking and depression but I've never wanted to rely on taking pills mostly because of the side effects of said pills or of the withdrawal. I've never really taken anything for my anxiety in the past but I haven't found any “natural” remedy that fixes me at my worst moments.I had a doctor prescribe me busporine(sp?) when I was in high school but I couldn't take it daily because it made me too tired to drive or function properly at school so I only took it when I felt particularly bad but it never gave me any abnormal side effects.I really want to try lexapro but I'm so nervous about not really getting anything out of it and then having to cut it out. I guess this is ironic because I don't want to have to worry about stuff like this anymore, that was the whole point of the visit lol I don't deal with nausea or headaches well and having to rely on pills scares me.\n",
      "I really need some advice, the new year is only 30 minutes away, and my year was rough.I started having panic attacks in the final exams of the first semester after I doubled the dose of Ritalin, and then anxiety just haunts me. I had to quit my job at an excelente Company, Boston Scientific, because whenever I'm driving to anywhere I have anxiety attacks and i have the thought that I'm gonna die from a heart attack or something.On top of that I started to take unprescribed Klonopin for about two weeks now, everyday, and the dosage keeps getting higher, so is my anxiety.Tonight I caught myself mixing it with alcohol just to feel good and calm.The hole keeps getting deeperI don't know what to do anymore\n",
      "This may be hard to articulate.. I suffer from anxiety and depression so I truly empathize with my best friend. I've had it for 9 years so I've learned coping strategies blah blah blah (not about me). He just recently started struggling about a year ago. He's drinks a lot to cover the pain and is always the most drunk everytime our friends go out. Like sloppy drunk, always loses his phone, licsense, etc. We all know he has a problem but most of my friends are scared to say anything about it because he can be very confrontational and the rest of us like to have a good time. This has been going on for 4 years. He dropped out of college, has no job, and got kicked out his house. The hardest part it seems is that our community has extremely high expectations with a majority of the friend group making serious money at just 24. He's recently started antidepressants and benzodiazepines, seeing therapist, and AA to cope and he says it's helping but he still has horrible habits. He smokes weed every single day and still gets super drunk (by himself most nights). He sleeps all day and stays up all night. He doesn't exercise and eats like crap. The worst part is I KNOW HOW HE FEELS... IVE BEEN THERE... We talk about what each other goes through but usually only when he's drunk. Right now all of our best friends are in a house for New Years and he's upstairs sleeping... it's 6:45pm... It's just so frustrating because my anxious mind always goes to the worst places. He told me he used to be really suicidal (slept with a knife under his pillow) but didn't tell anyone and that just destroys my soul. I want to take care of him, I want to tell him it all gets better. I want to yell at him and tell him the only way he's gonna feel better is doing the things that are good for him. I want to say all these things but I just don't want to upset him because he's so confrontational and I know when I was in that place it just makes you feel worse. I literally worry about him every single day. I check his location frequently because I'm worried something might happen. If he doesn't text in the group chat I get worried that he's done the unthinkable. Even right now I'm downstairs with my friends worried he swallowed all his medication. I just have no clue what to do. I just want my friend to be okay. Maybe I can only be there for him when he needs it. It's weird because I really pay the most attention to him when my anxiety is bad. The thing is I know that I can handle myself but I'm never sure if he can handle himself. I love him with all my heart. Please if anyone resonates with this or has any advice, feel free to respond. Thanks for reading\n",
      "I went out of turn at a stop sign today because the two people who got there before me just sat there and as soon as I decided to go all of a sudden one of them paid attention and decided to go and almost hit me and then looked at me like I was crazy and gave me a “what the fuck is wrong with you”? hand signal. This is so stupid that I'm even writing about this but I've felt TERRIBLE all day, telling myself that I'm a horrible person for doing this at a stop sign and keep thinking about how she looked at me. How do I stop beating myself up about stuff like this?\n"

I would love to go, but I don't want to sit there by myself while everyone else is there with a group, and I feel like I will stick out like a sore thumb, looking like a loser having drinks by myself.

Does anyone have experience with sensitivity to EVERYTHING? It could be world issues, my family, relationships, everything. I think of my parents and get anxious thoughts about their future, health, etc. I think of our world as far as things such as climate change, world peace, etc. I'm always worrying about something.

      "I have known this guy for almost two years. Yesterday he skew if we could pick up his buddy from the store since his car broke down and it was really cold out. I said sure and we pick his buddy up from the store. Well my friend wanted to stop at the gas station and his buddy stayed in the car with me. I have never met his buddy before; I only saw him once and he just kind of looked at me for a couple seconds and looked away. He was smoking in the car and he had burrowed my friend's lighter and my friend told his buddy to give the lighter back to me when he was done using it. He gave the lighter back to me and he rolled down the window and was like \"oh your back windows roll down all the way; in most cars the back ones don't roll down all the way.\" We didn't talk at all anymore and it was kind of uncomfortable. We all went back to my friend's house and I get anxious really bad. They sat on the couch and smoked and I just stood awkwardly as if I were frozen or something. My friend kept telling me he wanted me to stay and hangout with them but I just wanted to go home and I did. Do you think he thinks I'm a freak? I'm in my mid-twenties and my friend and his buddy are in their late-twenties.\n",
      "I literally just got the prescription today, 10mg, so I understand that I need to take it for at least a couple days and it takes two weeks to usually see it work but after only taking it once today I hate it. I threw up my dinner, I can't stomach to eat anything else even though I feel like I'm starving, I feel disoriented like just kind of out of it and dizzy. Is this just the beginning onset of the medication and it will get better? Or am I having a negative reaction to the medication? I still plan to take it tomorrow and if it continues this badly I'm probably going to quit taking it and not even go through the whole two weeks. I used to be on sertraline about five years ago and stayed on it for about four years because I was extremely depressed. It worked very well and gave me pretty much no side effects. and then quit for the last year because I didn't think I needed it anymore but then recently I got panic attacks and my doctor thought that this would be a better medication for me because he says it works best with physical anxiety symptoms.\n",

And they understand, even if they may not say anything, they know. Allow the year to end, with goals of making this next year the best that you can. Not everything is permanent. Not even this.

How am I going to live through graduate school if the application is this horrible?? I put off applying to any grad school for six years because I had such a traumatizing final year of college because of anxiety. I don't suppose it was technically traumatizing, I don't want to use the word trauma lightly, but I developed chronic panic attacks that year, that I still struggle with. I have OCD, and I've been battling it my whole life, but panic attacks made dealing with OCD even more unbearable. I finally got them under control last year, and only have them occasionally now (at my worst I had multiple daily). But anyone with panic attacks knows they are absolutely no fun ever. Also my compulsions are minimal now, but my disorder takes so much maintenance. I've just recently started going to therapy only once every two weeks instead of weekly, because I want to try to be more independent, it's expensive, and I'm finally doing better, but I've noticed it's noticeably more difficult to get by with less frequent therapy. How will I survive without my therapist?? These are all things I've discussed with my therapist, but the approach my my first deadline is making these thoughts race.

      "I came home stressed about work, had been fighting off a panic attack over it all day. They don't happen very often but it was just an avelanche of things. I was worried about my performance, additional pressures, balancing it all, exhausted from being super hands on, on my way home someone asking for money tailed me a little bit aggressively between two stations; everything mixed together meant that by the time is gotten home I was feeling really taut and trying to wrestle it under control. Well it was Nye, so, waited until midnight and it's SO loud outside mixed with impending 5am and the knowldege I needed to high perform on less and less sleep. Just ended up having a panic attack. I(f29) went to the living room and was quiet about, and when I had calmed a little I went back to bed and couldn't control my shaking and cold tremors. I told my bf (30m) I was cold but he was pretty irritated with me and ended up just getting up and going to sleep on the sofa. When I tried to get him back into bed, which is comfier and I explained what a panic attack was and how it was nothing related to him, he told me that it was pretentious and a charade. I'm quite hurt about it. He doesn't have work today and I made it very clear the second I came home that I'd had some kind of day and wasn't feeling great. Over the course of the evening he was kept in the loop. But when push came to shove, he didn't simply ignore that I was having a panic attack- which would have been fine actually- but he tried to gaslight to existence of it. Outside of sending him some resources so he can read up and better understand, I don't know what to do after seeing that.TDLR; I had a panic attack last night. It sucked. What sucked more is my bf's response. I don't know if I'm overreacting at it.\n",

      "Just randomly writing down some thoughts that will turn into an ode about friendship. Forgive me for my crappy English at times.I've always been a loner. Ever since I was a kid I never really had friends. I would feel alone as a 7 year old during recess, wandering and wondering why nobody won't come and play with me. Everybody else seemed to have a best friend and I would just float in between. Kids would play outside after school and I wouldn't be allowed to play outside at least till I was 8 yo, after we moved to better location.I've always stood on the sidelines, watching, thinking, longing for friendship but never actually having it. Once I moved to a new neighboorhoud I could play outside and connect with 3 others, the regular friendgroup. However, they sometimes would not pick me up and I would play with legos or game in my room. Create my own very fantasy world that would keep me busy for hours.At sports, I would enjoy the company, but never actively engage it. A few of them in all the years reached out to me, there was a connection, but I didn't know what to do with it. I sometimes reacted on it, but I would also just ignore the signs that somebody else was willing and looking forward to spend time with me.Whenever I finally caught on, they would move away. Now I was 3x times a week handball practice, so was there a lot. I would eventually connect with someone but they moved to Yemen (of all places.) A year later there was a new buddy, but he would move away too.Now, on highschool. I thought I had friends, but after passing the first year and doing extremely well I moved up education wise and was placed in a new class with new people. As I learned I was watchfull, not reaching out and not trying to connect. Along came some classmates with I'd often sit next to and we eventually bonded. However, that was a lie and they dropped me quite hard on a schooltrip for a week to another country. All the loneliness inside me got confirmed and that I am not suppose to have friends.I walled myself of for any friendship. I spend the last 2 years of highschool alone and my follow up study (teacher) I would do the same. As a guy on a mostly predominated female field of job I didn't make a lot of guy friends, none in fact. And handball kinda dwindled down into just going to the weekly matches. I spend most of my days studying and gaming (thank you WoW, but not really) Going out with friends, have some drinks, get wasted etc. was not part of my world. My mother (which is a chapter on its own) actively discouraged me from even attempting it).After finishing my study and getting a job as a primary schoolteacher I got to work with adults. They were like 30 yo and me a young 20 yo. I looked up to them, thinking they knew life and understood it. At the same time, I was a master in making myself invisible, not heard, not seen. Since why would anyone want to see me? For the first time in years I was invited a long for drinks and general fun. I would be the quiet one, silently enjoying myself but also being all too worried I would do anything wrong and why they would like me. Sometimes I wasn't invited along and instead of asking why or just going myself it was a feeling all too familiar. Not belonging, not being wanted. By my mother, by friends due to myself.4 years another guy came to work at the school I currently work at. And again, I was pretty much the only young guy working there. This guyco-worker is everything I am not. Socially engaging, charming, funny, big network of friends and easy going..... and we became friendsbuddies.With NYE I was over at his parentsfamily ; friends. I was selfconcious the entire time. Worried how I come across, despite me knowing them for 4 years now. And yet I am truly happy for it. This co-worker, I got wasted with him.

      "Somethings gotta give. I have crippling anhedonia and anxiety that causes my “recovered” eating disorder brain to be obsessed with food. I have schizoid personality disorder and am on adderall so I have no chance of joining the army soon and I just want outHappy New Years\n",
      "I just needed somewhere to express myself, I'm sorry if this isn't 100% easy to understand.For years I've been battling against mild anxiety, it's been something I've been able to deal with and live with for the most part with little to no issues.6 months ago, a woman I was previously in a relationship with had asked to rekindle things after she broke up with me the time before, saying that she was regrettable for the decisions she made etc.I being naive took her back, after much heart ache, only to have her, after months of getting things back to good, two days after we start dating again she breaks up with me and never speaks to me again. Shortly after I heard from mutual friends that she did it on purpose.Since that day, my mild anxiety which I've been able to live with has turned into what I'd call high level anxiety, not only that I've been struggling for 6 months to make friends, have new relationships due to my newly found relationship anxiety, and my trust issues. I've found myself having days when i can't leave the house due to anxiety, I feel sad more often than not, my diet and gym regime have gone to shit and it's just been an awful year.So last week, I decided after years of considering it, to see someone and talk about my issues (I've seen therapists before). Anyhow, On Monday I was prescribed medication to treat my anxiety and depression and it was the hardest thing I've done, to break down in front of my doctor and feel embarrassed and less of a man, but I'm hoping that despite that, this year, and this new decade brings me a chance to live normally, love normally and to trust again, hopefully with less anxiety, and less overall stress.I guess I'm just trying to say, as a man, it's okay to feel embarrassed and scared to see someone, but you don't have to, my doctor was more than understanding and it actually made me feel really safe.Thanks for letting me vent, reddit fam. Be good this year to yourselves, we can do it together, much love.\n",
      "Hey guys, I've not been actually diagnosed with anxiety yet but both me and my doctor believe that I may have it as it appears to be the cause of many of my IBS flare ups.The last time I went to the doctors they put me on propranolol to help with headaches that they believed would be caused as a result of anxiety.I don't usually talk to girls, however I messaged this one girl on Instagram at the start of the week that I had met at a concert, and with the help of my friends (who are much more experienced than I am) I was able to get her snapchat, however it didn't go far after there as I pussied out.The thing is though, is that ever since the first day I messaged this girl, my stomach has been going crazy, I've lost appetite, I've looked way to much into what I should do when I see this girl at a thing we are both going to tonight. I didn't even go out last night for the bells as my stomach was going insane. (She wasn't even going to what I would have went to)It sorta clicked in finally for me that anxiety was the cause as I woke up this morning feeling perfect, I sorta smiled but then suddenly had a thought of “your going to see the girl tonight at the concert” and my stomach instantly started churning, searing pain and I'm currently sitting on the pan for about 15 minutes.What should I do in this case, does anyone else get this similar feeling? I don't want what I believe to be anxiety to stop me from going out and having fun with my life.I've Been taking propranolol, mebeverine, and peppermint caps to help.Thank you.\n",
      "Does anyone else have a feeling that you don't really belong in a given environment whenever people are happy around you?Personally, I can't help but feel lonely when people are smiling. It's as if I don't deserve to be happy myself. I'm pretty sure it's not about the people I meet with, as I've been seeing multiple groups of different people, it's always the same. Honestly, I would rather just spend the NYE alone so I don't ruin the fun for anyone, instead of faking a smile whenever people around me smile as well.This feeling sucks.\n",
      "I've been sick with bronchitis and the cough is killing me. I saw the doctor for it and it's not really a problem. However, around midnight I was watching TV and had a bad coughing fit. Felt like I couldn't breathe and I lost it. I was afraid to take my clonopin because I got this idea it would interact with the other shit I'm taking. By the time I get to the ER, I'm a shaking, crying mess feeling like I'm gonna die.Everything worked out, but my attacks are getting more frequent and severe. It's embarrassing. I took 2 sick days last month because of anxiety.\n",
      ". I was at a New Years Party on my dads side of the family and had talked to more people in there than I have in the entire 7 months of online classes I did at home. Messed up handshakes, saying the wrong things, awkward silences. There's not enough space to have your dignity by the end of the night. It's one of those things you'll have in the back of your head in years and think “fuck why did I do that” and even though I embarrassed myself infront of my cousins and unclesaunts.. I know it's for the better. And they will probably forget about it.\n",
      "Anybody know If sertaline can raise blood pressure? I been taking 50mg for a month and past couple of days I been getting agitated fast breathing and pins and needles and dizzy. Not sure if its cuz vaping, sertraline for diazipam?\n",
      "So I have huge anxiety and paranoia around accidents , to an extent which I feel most simply wouldn't understand because of how extreme and pronounced my fear is . It's like when everyone's at home together my fear is reduced to an extent because I know that if something did happen that other people would be around to help . But when someone's out of the house I fly into a panic because I believe they're going to be killed in a road accident or something if they're home ten minutes later than usual . Anyway going off topic , I use self harm as a coping mechanism but yesterday evening I took two paracetamol (which I know people are probably thinking is stupid because that's no where near enough to be classed as an overdose) but I know I didn't need to take those pills and it was kind of (as fucked up as it sounds ) me proving to myself that I could take an overdose next time if I wanted to if I took more tablets ) I don't really want to die as such I want to protect myself from being exposed to others dying through disease and trauma etc.\n",
      "Hi. This is my first time posting in this subreddit.I'm really curious if anyone else here also suffers with selective mutism? I've never met anyone else with it. I was my therapist's first and only case. Here's my whole up and down story with selective mutism. It's kind of a long winded story so if you don't read that's fine I just want to get my story out there and also find out if there's anyone else here. I've had it as long as I can remember starting back when I was in an abusive foster care home. That was when I was 4. My parents said that before I was \"super talkative\" but after I just got quite. For the first year of being home with my family I only whispered to them. It took until my baby sister was born for me to talk out loud to them. When school started I learned to just whisper to the teachers. But before I had to make sure no peers were in earshot.  I just saw school as a living hell that I had to endure everyday. If a classmate wasn't asking \"Why don't you talk?\" they were trying to trick me into talking or trying to make me laugh (looking back I appreciate but at the time I hated). I would always want to join in on their conversations and they would try and get me to; I would even have a whole response drafted in my head of to what to say but there would be almost like a dam blocking the words from coming out of my mouth. Sometimes I would write it down on paper and give it to them and sometimes I would try to \"show\" it. It would always upset me when they misinterpreted what I was trying to say and then they would run with it. I would be so frustrated because it's not what I meant. When my parents would pick me up from school, I would not open my mouth until the car doors were shut and the windows were up; I was that terrified of someone hearing me. From preschool to 5th grade I didn't give a crap about school for obvious reasons. But in 5th grade I finally had a teacher who didn't try and force me to live up to the other kids standards or try and dumb everything down for me. He set goals for me and he made sure that I met those goals, whether that was staying with me after school, taking me into a separate room if I had questions, or regularly checking with me that I was good at my desk throughout the day. He made me care about school and made the learning enjoyable for me. Back on the school track. I went from being a D student to A student within the year.After 5th grade I made sure to get everything done and do it fully. On a side note I did have 1 true friend throughout some of this. This was in 1st grade. We became friends after she told me to call her when I got home (she gave me her number). When I did I sat there with listening to her saying \"Hello?\" for a good couple minutes and I finally got up enough courage to say \"Hi.\" I immediately hung up the phone. After that weird exchange, I then started to whisper to her and continued to do so until about 5th grade when I finally had enough trust in her to speak normally. We spent so many hours watching Disney channel and playing club penguin and making dumb YT videos (basically normal early 2000's kids stuff). We stayed best friends until about 8th grade when she went down a deep hole of depression and anxiety and so I did I and we just stopped talking. And we haven't really talked much sense. The only time I can really remember was when her grandpa died I showed up for a couple minutes at his celebration of life. I was every teacher's' pet... their *very* quiet pet, lol. All my projects and essays would be used as examples. I was proud that I was able to do that.  It stayed that way until 9th grade.  The year started great as normal (I was already acclimated to the school because it was a JrSr high so all grades 7th-12th were there; there was no real difference between the two because it was the same building and same teachers). Anyway, I started having to miss classes to go to my therapy appointments (which were an hour away because we live in a small town). The fear of facing the teachers and my peers and having to explain (at least to the teachers) what I was going on; I started to freak out. I started asking my dad to let me stay home \"because I have an appointment later.\" BTW tail end of 8th grade was when I started seeing my therapist (I'd never seen one before) and that was only because I begged my parents because I felt like no one could understand me at school. Anyway, I also started taking antidepressants in October of that year so it probably factored into this.I stopped going to school. My dad would literally drag me out of my bed. One time while my school counselor and vice principal was there he dragged me out of the car so I could go to school. I just ended up having more panic attacks because I felt like everyone was disappointed in me. A few months before this is also when I got my emotional support cat, Minnie. She went to and still goes to every single therapy appointment with me. She'll either sit next to me or she'll go and do something in the office until she senses I'm starting to worry. Anyway, again, then some really bad family stuff happened and it just added on to the crap pie. All you need to know was my whole family had to stay at my grandma's house. I ended up missing so much school I was marked as truant and was set to appear in court. Thank god my counselor at the school knew about the state's online school and she helped me get signed up for the next year. Back on the court thing, I didn't speak to the judge but my parents, my vice principal and counselor all said what was going on and that I was signed up for online school for the next year and my therapist even wrote him a letter. I remember while I was literally crying in front of him from the stress he asked my VP (she had to do it because of the state laws) \"Why on earth is she here?!\" and he sent me home. Online school was the first time I talked to non-friend peers. It took me until freaking 10th grade to actually have a conversation with a fellow peer!!! Now I'm a senior. I've done prom committee every year so far since I've been at the online school and made acquaintances with some peers. Now I work at Albertsons as a courtesy clerk and am kind of basically living on my own (in my grandma's house). Working had increased my social interactions at least 10 folds. Now that I'm working I'm seeing all the time that I've lost with social interaction. I've missed out on 13 years of learning. I keep getting told things by my manager that stems from not talking for X amount of years. She understands why but it still gets to me and I understand why she has to say it. (most of the time it's me making a bad jab at sarcasm or just me trying to control something). I have had now a couple panic attacks at work. The one time I literally had tears in my eyes but didn't want to stop to fully breakdown until my shift was over with which was about 3 hours. I was mildly... crying... in... those... 3... freaking... hours. THE WHOLE TIME!  I've now seen the same therapist for almost 4 years now. I haven't been able to talk to anyone from my old school yet but hope to eventually and hopefully I get up enough nerve to message my friend. In school I'm kind of falling behind because of procrastination and just senioritis; it's freaking exhausting. I'm working with my online school counselor to stay on track but it's still hard. I'm only half a credit behind on what I missed from Freshman year which I'll make up next semester.Anyway, thanks for reading my long winded story.\n",

I've always enjoyed Christmas being a child, not even entirely for the presents, which usually children are most excited for, but I've always enjoyed the family time when we all get together to celebrate. It's making me really sad to think that just last week I was having the time of my life and now I'm instantly back into reality again, and I guess I just can't take this, knowing that no fun events are going to take place for months ahead now and I've got fucking tons of exams to take. Literally just walking around seeing Christmas trees or decorations or seasonal things makes me instantly sad knowing it's gone. I was just wondering if anyone knew any methods of coping with this because I'd like to enjoy the last small amount of time I have remaining and it's really difficult for me to right now, thanks.\n",

      "Hello Reddit! First time posting and not sure how this works... but here we go.In the spirit of the New Year and trying to get my own shit together, this first post is about the fear I had to face last night on New Years Eve. Here is some background to get started: About 5 or 6  years ago or so, I had gotten out of a very emotionally abusive relationship that took place over the course of 2 years, things ended horribly. We have the same mutual friend group (since high school) and we are both always invited to the gatherings. However within these last few years, it has been impossible for me to be in the same vicinity or room with my ex ( last time I saw him walking down the street a few years ago I had a panic attack and couldn't keep it together), therefore I only went to gatherings where I knew for sure he wouldn't show. After being like this for years, and fearing to revert back to how shitty he made me feel, last night I kept my shit together. *Last Night:* As a last minute decision, my group decided to have a gathering for New years Eve. As I was getting ready to go out and enjoy my time with my friends, I get the news that my ex will be there with his girlfriend (she being 1 reason why things ended).  Queue freak out....I stop getting ready and begin to pace. My heart felt like it was beating out of my chest, I was extremely cold  and hot but sweating, and of course shaking like a leaf. After sitting down on my bedroom floor, my boyfriend asked how im feeling. I was feeling... scared, nervous, anxious, and hurt. Yet another holiday and gathering that I wont be able to attended because of HIM, so I feel angry and cheated. Although it been years since ive seen him, I dont ever want to feel the way I felt when I last saw him (panic attack mode) and will try to avoid that reaction again at all costs. Im so occupied by my feelings that my boyfriend so kindly reminds me to BREATHE and SLOW DOWN. I hadnt realized through the pacing and contemplation and sitting down not moving, I was not breathing the entire time. So finally I sit for a few minutes and try to calm my mind.After taking a few breaths, my boyfriend and I discuss our options: 1. We could go to my older brothers house and spend it there2. We could go catch a movie instead3. Or we could just stay homeBut, lately for gathering's that I do not attend because of this conflict, I start to feel cheated, and feel like I am missing out on great momentsmemories with MY friends. I am starting to get tired of missing out and not allowing myself to enjoy the people I love because of somebody else's influence. I want things to be different.After suggesting I check in with my brothers to see what they are up to, my younger brother decides to come with me to the party. So with the encouragement and help from my boyfriend and brother I decide to finally make this the year that I show up. The car ride over was nerve wracking, and getting out of the car was worse. But thanks to some herbal medication, I clouded my mind enough to enter the house.  My heart starts beating quickly and I start sweating as soon as I see him. SO I avoid any eye contact or opportunities that may potentially open the floor to us interacting. And immediately I decide that I, in no way have to interact with him at all while being here. So I dont. After a few sake shots and heavily medicating myself to make sure I dont feel any kind of emotion, I get through it. I didnt interact with him or his girlfriend ( sorry but I have no interest in any part of this mans life and have no interest in hearing anything from either of them), didnt even walk past or get close enough to strike conversation or be bothered by him. So I did it. Although I was unconformable, on high alert,  and working hard to just be there, I got through and have proven to myself that I can now be in the same area as he is and I can now fully enjoy all the time I want with my friends. And although it wasnt done in the healthiest of ways, I still did it. Even though I did it, I will most likely still be mindful of attending if he is, I dont want to have to use all my energy to be normal and focus on not freaking out, I dont want to have to work to enjoy something that shouldn't require work. I shouldnt have to be on high alert or uncomfortable when spending time with my friends and not even enjoy the gathering. So im starting this New Year off by overcoming my fear. Regarding the situation and my ex, im not better, BUT im okay.... and I will continue to work at this. Hopefully one day I wont have to work at controlling my emotions, anxiety, and pretending to be completely comfortable when im not. Im very thankful to my boyfriend, brother  and supportive friends who helped me in overcoming this one night and understand my needs enough to know when im okay and when im not. Thank you.\n",

      "Warning: existentialism Does anyone else slip into an anxiety episode when there's a big celebration like prom, weddings, big anniversary, or New Years? I think the thought of us all having the “time of our lives” to something rather insignificant in the grand scheme of things reminds me of how meaningless our human lives are. Of course is a complete buzzkill and I wish I didn't think this way. Anyone else do this or have overcome this kind of episode trigger?\n",

Last night was NYE and I havent heard from her since before 8pm. Im just worried that something might have happened. Usually we message more than this. Can somebody please just tell me it will be okay. I had a terrible dream and woke up sad and worried.\n",

      "Hi y'all. I'm a 23 year old with panic disorder. I've called the paramedics so many times they recognize me. I have daily anxiety and panic, thanks to health anxiety.I have been on an SSRI for 3 years to try and combat the anxiety. It helped until a few months ago when I had a *major* panic flare, resulting in my need to take Xanax *daily*. To try and combat the anxiety, I was switched to a new SSRI, Lexapro. Took it for two months at a low dose and it wasn't for me. Felt lethargic and had vision problems. Still needed Xanax daily which isn't ideal.So, my psych prescribed Buspar and told me to stop the Lexapro. I did. I think I'm experiencing SSRI withdrawals because I'm having worsening panic, nightmares, muscle aches, headaches, confusion, and  feelings of general unwellness. It's scary and hyping up my health anxiety and panic disorder. The withdrawal makes sense since I've been on some form of low dose SSRI for years, but it's scary and I'm feeling kind of terrified. I'm hoping the Buspar will help but who knows, it's only been about 5 days. I'm wondering if there's a light at the end of the tunnel, and if anyone else with panic disorder has tolerated SSRI withdrawals, or has anything good to say about Buspar, or has words of support. Anxiety is scary and I'm admittedly in a severe flare up.\n",

      "I can't stop thinking about everything that can go wrong, especially which family members I could lose in the new decade. New Year's is always awful for me.I have an extremely irrational fear of losing my mom because she's all I have. I'm 27 F, single, and not interested in getting married or having a family but that scares the hell out of me. I need a family in the future or else I'll be alone but I don't want it, if that makes sense. I don't want to put effort into dating and going through all that.My mom is in good health now but I am crippled almost daily with the thought of losing her someday. After a break-up about 2 years ago, I've had this extreme issue with loss. I was suicidal when my ex broke up with me because I felt I lost the future I was meant to have. I always have feared losing my mom, and when I was dating someone I felt like I didn't have to worry about that anymore because I'd marry this person and have a family to be with me forever.I feel like when my mom dies, I will want to die too because I'll have no one. I'm too scared to be alone. I will never have a job that makes enough money for rent, let alone bills, food, and a car. There's no way I could do that on my own.I need to see a therapist but I am not allowed the time off work to go. I can't find anyone available after work or on weekends, so I'd have to take an hour away each day, which I'd have to make up and I'm not willing to do that. My work hours are very strict and my manager demands I stay longer some days and make my hours \"flexible\". I'm basically at the mercy of him and when he allows me to go home for the night. I'm only a secretary but he's a controlling prick. Idk I can't stand this. I need help.\n",

      "  Hey everyone, looking for a little help on settling my constant worry regarding freelance work—even though it shouldn't be an issue with the information I'm about to submit. But over the last year, the constant cloud of anxiety has eroded any form of peace-at-mind. My sleeping has faltered, as has my athletic training, and I've also started to drink a lot more which was prompted a number of callouts from my friends. Nothing drastic or heavy, just a few beers each night, but practically all seven days of the week. I've been working as a freelancer for a number of years, and I found the perfect role working for an incredibly successful company. Over the past several years, my rate has continued to increase, the amount of work I've been given continues to grow to the point where I sometimes have to decline a job because I'm already stretched thin, and the people who work there, now my friends, continually tell me that I never have to worry about this line of work stopping. For all accounts, it's indefinite. Now, I should happily be strolling through life thinking that I've been gifted a great opportunity. Instead, I've spent the better part of the last two years constantly worried, tearful, and somedays breathless, at thinking about what I would do if this job vanished. Of course, it's a possibility it could vanish, but in all counts with the years of evidence, it's highly unlikely.  With that, does anybody have any suggestions on how I can start metaphorically breath again?\n",

I was trying to be positive and my anxiety has been pretty good for the past week. Anyway, Happy New Year guys. If you're struggling, just try to think about those moments of peace. Shut your eyes. Let your mind wander to your happy place while you rest. ❤️\n",
      "I become enraged when old acquaintances comment that I have gotten \"thick\". I have struggled on and off with an eating disorder and body dysmorphia since I was 12. My fear of gaining weight is heightened when I receive comments such as \"I didn't even recognize you from behind because my \"ass looks so big!\" I believe that these comments are harmless ?? but I have trouble coping with them. It happened twice in one week. All of my acquaintances have graduated from college and are moving back to our home city and we all revolve around the same circles. And shortly after my close friend asked me if I had gained weight. I responded that I didn't know. She just looked at me, shrugged, and got on with another conversation. I feel that I am supposed to accept my weight gain and love myself anyway but it is so difficult when receiving the comments. I believe I am supposed to be complemented by being told that I have \"gained weight in the right places\" but I honestly don't want to be told anything. I, personally, would never tell someone that. A simple \"you look great\" is fine.  After these comments, I began obsessively looking at myself in the mirror but becoming too overwhelmed to exercise. My anxiety around my weight and appearance can be horrible. I notice it affecting my confidence and relationships. I sprained my ankle really bad and won't be able to exercise on my feet for two months. I know exercise will positively impact my mental and physical health. But I don't know if my insecurity and anxiety over my appearance will stop there. I plan to get my birth control arm implant removed and switch to an IUD for VARIOUS reasons (weight gain, irregular period, increase of depression). If comfortable, I would like to start a discussion around this topic. What do you do to relieve the anxiety of overwhelming physical societal expectations? And what do you practice to show yourself love? Or how do you relate? Do you also think it sucks?\n",
      "How do you guys deal with anxiety in a relationship??My ex (22m) and I (24f) are currently trying to work things out and fix our past problems. So far it's been going really great and we've taken some important steps to move forward but then all of a sudden I have days like today where I'm just hyper aware of everything that we haven't addressed or fixed yet. I know only time can fix these things but I feel like it really puts a heavy weight on the day and I hate it. Like I need everything to be resolved immediately. Does this happen to anyone? Any ideas how to make these thoughts stop running through my head?\n",
      "I love her but she is the root cause of my anxiety. She's ALWAYS super high strung even though 2 of her 3 kids (including me) have moved out. Nothing is ever good enough for her, she always has to be right and she will critique me for any little minutia of my behavior, hygiene, etc. I'm sick of coming home twice a year just to get yelled at for getting a drop of water on the counter, or her getting mad because I forgot to put one thing in the kitchen away after making food, or getting told I need to smile more, or her saying “you brushed your teeth right?” Despite the fact that I'm 20 years old and have been brushing my teeth multiple times a day since I was 12. In the oldest of three and sometimes it feels like the only times she notices me is when I'm doing something she doesn't approve of or if I'm not doing something exactly the way she wants it done.  I can't stay at home for more than two weeks without it taking a toll on my mental health. It's claustrophobic and I'm sick of it. I love her to death but she needs to realize how fucking ridiculous her expectations are. She's made me feel like nothing I do is ever good enough no matter what. Her attitude sucks I hate it. How do I deal with this? I've told her multiple times about how she makes me feel but it's like she doesn't listen to what I'm saying. I'm far from perfect but I know damn well I'm more put together than she thinks. It's fucked my self esteem up for years and honestly I'm not sure I'm gonna come home again for a long time.\n",
      "I am rather exasperated with my anxiety. I am medicated (Venlafaxine, 75mg per day)--my anxiety presents itself as hypochondria. For instance, just yesterday I found a tiny \"rough patch\" on my inner gum and my first instinct was to start googling (and of course every search result was like \"oral cancer maybe?\"). This isn't the first time I've found myself searching the internet to self-diagnose, and even in my younger years before the internet really took off I would browse my parents various encyclopedias and random health texts in search of answers.My first bout with hypochondria occurred when I was about 9-10; I got sick at a family breakfast and my mom sat in the car with me. I was certain (though I don't know why) that I might be dying, so I prayed. Cut to my sophomore year at college--a same-sex encounter led me to fear that what turned out to be a cold might actually be the onset of HIV (I basically just had the chills). I drove myself to the emergency room at 2 a.m. for a test; five days and $400 later (I don't know how I managed to swing that bill) I found out I was HIV negative.When I attempted to ween myself off my venlafaxine about 3 years ago, my hypochondria returned. I was in grad school at this point and a nurse practitioner was kind enough to point out that I kept coming in fearing that various symptoms could be different types of cancer. I did have one legit \"scare\" about a year ago where I had a small lump in my throat biopsied but it was negative. Even though I am medicated now, the rough patch I discovered on my gums was enough to set me searching via Google, and needless to say I was up quite late and I still find myself thinking about it, though I am trying to catch myself in these thoughts and telling myself \"If it doesn't going away in the next week or so, just ask the dentist or doctor to look at it, no biggy.\" Still that doesn't prevent me from catastrophizing a few minutes later.Does anyone else struggle with hypochrondria? Has anyone overcome it? I did manage to overcome the social anxiety I struggled with for years thanks to Cognitive Behavioral Therapy, and I am considering finding a therapist in my area and discussing my hypochondria with me. Any thoughts you could provide are much appreciated! Thanks and happy new year, ranxiety!\n",
      "When will my brain just stop....I was driving to work and a series of things going wrong caused one of the most horrific panic attacks I've ever had. I almost crashed and had to pull over while violently hyperventilating. It took 30 mins before I was able to consider driving home. I've only been able to text my boss not call in, she hasn't replied much and I'm having waves of guilt about not going in. My job is customer service so i know I couldn't hack it, but a part of me feels like I should be pushing myself harder. If I had flu I wouldnt have this anxiety about not going in...\n",
      "Today, I had plans to walk to my friend's house and hang out. I havent hung out with my friend in months, so i thought i would be so nice. but as i was getting ready to walk outside, my stomach started churning and i got uncomfortable and felt sick. i had to cancel, and i feel horrible about it. right now its hard to just go near the windows. my usual ways of calming myself down arent working as much anymore and im scared.im sorry if this is messy, im just not in the best state right now\n",
      "Ok folks just joined this group for reason I'm about to say. Supposed to go to my parents for New Years dinner today. Fiancé who occasionally gets bad anxiety about doing certain things usually when it's going to be around other people is really upset about it and getting bad anxiety. My mom is an intense lady who won't understand the anxiety. What can I tell her to get out of today? Should I be honest with her? I don't want to throw my fiancé under the bus.\n",
      "I first started having panic attacks at age 15 and then was diagnosed with panic disorder at 17. I really lost a lot of friends during this time because I really isolated myself. It wasn't just the agoraphobia but also I felt guilty about making other people deal with my anxiety and fearing that they would just get annoyed. And so I stopped hanging out with people out of fear of making them upset. Now I'm 19 and I really only have to best friends, a childhood friend and my boyfriend. Everyone else I would feel uncomfortable sharing my struggles with and so the ‘friendship' is never able to become really deep and genuine. I'm super close with my family and I'd rather hang out with them tbh...But now I'm turning 20 soon and I don't really have a social friend group at all...can anyone relate ? Just felt like sharing\n",
      "Hi,So everytime I watch a violent scene, like knife stabbing, torture, or anything that is related to evil I get extreme anxiety. Just a few hours ago I was at the movies watching this amazing film but there was this scene with a garden party and then this guy started to stab everyone with a knife, people were laying in the grass with big wounds, blood was everywhere, people were screaming and crying and I only saw glimpses of it cause I couldn´t watch. Even the sounds of the knife stabbing drove me into anxiety. (Even writing it out makes me feel really bad). I felt like I couldn´t breathe, and that I had to run away from there. I managed to stay during the whole scene but on my way home I couldn´t stop thinking about it. I got tunnel vision, felt like I was about to faint, and was paranoid that everyone around me would stab me or something similar. When I got home I burst into tears sobbing. I don´t know why I get this extreme of a reaction. I´ve been like this ever since I can remember but I can´t figure out why. I know I don´t have a phobia of blood cause I´m not particularly afraid of blood otherwise. I definitely can´t watch the news or even hear or discuss things related to murder without feeling that I have to run away from there or distract myself. Sometimes it´s fine though, for example in an action movie I can watch people get shot and stuff. I can´t really tell why some things are okay to watch or hear about and why some aren´t. The feeling I get is hard to explain but it´s like I get a stomach ache and my heart feels like it´s being attacked and there is this overwhelming feeling that claws into my heart and I can´t get rid of it. It feels like it´s going to take me away or bring me somewhere I don´t want to be. It feels like I have been through it before and that it´s going to happen to me again and that that is why it get so close and haunting. It sort of feels like I have some sort of post traumatic stress but I don´t know any event that could have caused this.   If anyone knows what this might be or if anyone feels the same or has any clue of how to process it or make it less extreme I´d be very thankful.\n",
      "I spend almost every day in varying states of dread and apprehension. It feels like I have nervous butterflies in my chest and stomach and there's absolutely no respite outside of sleeping. My OCD-like tendencies have increased by a lot and day-to-day life is becoming a chore. I was first prescribed one SSRI which made everything worse, and then I was prescribed another SSRI which has made everything worse once again, only now I have more physical side effects such as tremors, shaking, and as of recent very slight issues maintaining balance. My psychiatrist now wants to put me on an antipsychotic which according to my research is a nightmare for a majority of the people using it.I have no support system. I have no friends due to my issues and inability to sustain a friendship. My partner has their own slew of mental illnesses and at this point views me as a burden. My mother is indifferent to my issues and will react to me having a panic attack as if it's an annoying inconvenience. I've also been accused of everything being a \"bit\" by her.Every little thing is setting me off, I'm uncomfortable literally all day, every day, medication doesn't work, and all I want is to be normal. I'm not getting any younger, I completely wasted any opportunities I had to have a \"fun\" younger life. I just want to get better. I want to be normal.\n",

      "TW: sui ideation,inpatient So, I admitted myself to an inpatient program about a week and a half ago for 5 days because I was a danger to myself and maybe others. I may have (in my opinion definitely) been having a manic episode, especially as I had been building in days before and didn't come down fully til a day or so later. I'd been diagnosed with depression about a decade ago at 14 and in the last 2 months I'd been diagnosed with depression with mixed features. I was on cymbalta 60 mg, and had lamictal added and 50-100 mg trazadone to deal with feeling too good all the time and sleeping issues. I'm just confused because I feel like, while I'm kinda glad I didn't get diagnosed with bipolar in the hospital (it's automatically bipolar 1 if you go to the hospital for it?) I just feel like doctors are trying really hard not to diagnose me with it at all. So I left with a mood disorder not otherwise specified diagnosis and got my lamictal swapped for lithium. Anyone have a similar story or thoughts on the situation?\n",

I guess what I'm asking is do the jitters make me a moody bitch or am I just a moody bitch with jitters?\n",

      "Hello everyone. Long story short ... after I had my first baby (at age 30) I was prescribed Zoloft and Ativan for anxiety, and it worked great. I felt less anxious, but stable. Fast forward to this past fall, after having my second child (at age 32), I went back on the Zoloft because it had worked so well before. About 2 weeks after starting it, I felt better than I ever had before in my whole life. Like I had it all together, and could do anything. My anxiety melted away, I could talk and banter with people, and my regular life was exciting and enjoyable. I didn't need much sleep, and jumped up out of bed in the morning eager to go to work (which is at an extremely dull job). While at work, I chatted up my coworkers nonstop when I had previously been quiet and reserved. I also spent about $6000 in 6 weeks time. I bought a new iPhone, MacBook Air, AirPods, and clothes for me and my kids. When I saw my psychiatrist for a check in at 6 weeks, I mentioned all this and he said it was hypomania and diagnosed me with Bipolar II. We stopped the Zoloft altogether and he put me on Seroquel, which I hated. It made me so tired I was constantly late to work and was basically on the verge of falling asleep all day. I felt extremely irritable and jittery, with racing thoughts. I was also acting very aggressively which is not my nature. After 2 weeks of Seroquel, he switched me to Abilify, which I've now been on for 2 weeks. I like it better than the Seroquel, but am still acting aggressively and my anxiety is through the roof. I'm experiencing what I think to be derealization because I am constantly anxious - the world looks hazy and different, and I feel odd and disconnected. Is this common with Bipolar? A symptom of mania, or just anxiety?Since I can't take SSRIs anymore, is there any long acting anti-anxiety med I can use to supplement the Abilify? Or any other recommendations? I am so out of sorts, and feel like a completely different person than I was before this second round of Zoloft. Any advice would be much appreciated.\n",

      "Husband moved out yesterday.I husband and I have been struggling for a long time. He was diagnosed with bipolar 1 disorder a few years ago. I feel like I'm at the end of my rope or am nearing it. Over the course of the eight years that we've been together, married for six, we've had domestic violence issues, psychiatric ward stay, police reports, and a daily miserable attitude from him there just never seems to subside. Everything is always my fault, in some way. Nothing makes him happy, nothing is good enough. When we go on any kind of vacation, he just complains the whole time about what a vacation costs and how it's not even worth it, and I find myself trying to be a cheerleader and trying to get him to enjoy it the whole time, rather than actually focusing on myself and our child. I feel like the show is all about him, all the time. He is an absent husband and father, he focuses on solely himself and his workouts and his business pursuits. But I cannot tell you the last time he changed a diaper or fed our child a meal. He is so supremely unhelpful that a few days ago I asked him if he could watch our child while I go to the bathroom, and he just looked at me and said, “can't you take himher in there with you?” And that's a small example. I can't tell you the last time that he tried to do anything nice for me. He is focused solely on himself and takes me and our child for granted entirely. Sometimes I wonder if he even loves us at all or if he just views us as a burden. I do a lot of secretary would like work for the business that he and I built, and I find that he is always nicer to me when he needs me to do something. In fact, the business is really all we have in common anymore and all our lives revolve around for him. My life revolves around our children and our family, his life revolves around money and working out and selfish pursuits that only benefit himself. I mean don't get me wrong, the benefits of the business obviously are important for our family financially, but where is the family man that I dreamed of? Where is the dad and husband? He doesn't even have to go to an office, he works from home. He just isn't ever “home”,  even when he is, if that makes sense.He and I barely talk anymore, the only time he really tries to have a conversation with me or even engage with me is if he has to talk to me about something to do with the business. I can't even remember the last time we just sat around and watched a movie or laughed together. All he does is sit down on his computer and watch YouTube videos of other businessman who he admires. All the while, our child and I sit upstairs by ourselves and play day after day and make memories. He's just not involved in any of them. If you look and his phone, there are 1 million pictures of motivational quotes, but no pictures of me and no pictures of our child. None. The only picture that he has is his screensaver of our child and it's only because I put it there months ago. So, fast forward. Two nights ago, we got into an argument during the day and he never came home that night. He claims he stayed at his parents, but I'm not so sure. I have not spoken to them because my relationship with my in-laws is rocky, as is his relationship with his parents. So I asked him to move out and after some arguing and push back on his part, he finally did. He will be staying with his parents for the time being until we figure out what we are going to do moving forward. I am struggling because I don't want to rip my family apart and I don't want my young child to suffer because of this all, which has nothing to do with them. And at the same time, I find my mind wandering, thinking that there has to be a better life out there for us both. Meaning my child and I. I have suffered so much and I just don't know how much more I can take. I used to think it was all the bipolar but as of late, I'm wondering if it's just who he is.The last thing I ever saw myself doing was considering divorce after having children, and it's breaking my heart. Am I overreacting? I just needed to vent and hopefully get some advice, hoping maybe some of you have been there.\n",
      "My life the past two years has been solely dedicated to college with at least 17 credits per semester, and even 12-15 during summer. But I thrive on a busy schedule, of always having something to do. So ever since I graduated this December, it's been rough being back at my parents for the holidays with literally no routine? I don't realize how much I need the schedule, of having something to do until it ends and then I get super down bc I don't know what's next or what i can do. Setting “little goals” doesn't really help either, so I can't be like I'll take a shower and clean my room. It's the fact that i don't have that stability I guess?

      "Had a very short but very intense mania period. Only a week long. Extreme joy and love and happiness at first. Then I started talking very quickly and passionately. Then I couldn't sleep. Talked for 14 hours straight, nonstop, 7 hours talking out loud to a person, 7 hours typing with people online. Nonstop. My eyes looked different. If you've never looked into the science of how your eyes physically change when you're manic, you should. Literally your eyes sparkle. People pointed it out to me without me even telling them. I went to a gas station with no makeup, hair a mess, in my pajamas, looking like an absolute mess and got hit on so intensely it scared me. I've never been hit on by a stranger, much less in my pajamas at a 7-11 just trying to buy a lighter. It was so weird. Felt weird that even though I wasn't saying anything or looking different, a stranger could pick up on my mania just by being around me. Colors were so vibrant that nothing looked normal. Then it got worse. Didn't sleep for 47 hours. Was shaking violently. Looked absolutely cracked out of my mind. It was embarrassing. I don't remember laying down or going to sleep, but eventually, my body just shut down and I slept for 6 hours, which in mania terms felt like a lot. When I woke up the next morning, I felt normal again.One week. 5 days of happiness and joy and love. 2 days of shaking and not sleeping. Didn't do anything stupid or that I regret. Kept my sanity and grip on reality the entire time. I may have been physically manic but I was mentally stable. I took care of myself. I rested a lot. I didn't drink any caffeine. I kept eating even though I didn't want to. And it was the least painful and easiest severe mania I've ever dealt with. Really proud of myself.Happy to be going into the new year feeling stable, loving myself, and healing from past traumas. I hope 2020 is a better year for all of us. Much love &lt;3\n",
      "I made a post on my old acct about me starting TMS treatments and some people said they were curious how it was gonna go for me. Here's an updateFor those who don't know, TMS stands for transcranial magnetic stimulation. They blast magnetic waves to the part of the brain most inactive for people with depression. The blast more, less intense ones to the part of your brain with too much activity for those with anxiety. It's 5 days a week for about 5 or 6 weeks. Then you taper down. It's something like 70% of people have reduction in symptoms and 39% have full remission. So I'm 34 of the way through. I'm still very depressed, but I'm no longer wanting to die every day and fantasize about self harm multiple times a day. I no longer feel hopeless to the point of not wanting to be alive. This is crazy to me! Can't remember the last time I haven't felt like that. Again I still am depressed. I experience a lot of ahedonia and apathy that I struggle greatly with. I'm hoping more will clear up as we go along. They said some people need boosters every 6 months, some once a year, some never. Hopefully I don't need it every 6 months as it's quite expensive even with insurance :(\n",
      "How common are hallucinations? I went into a mixed episode in late October early November and a symptom I was struggling with was hallucinations. I saw the shadow people and one that I called the moth man. I also had some that were not scary like cats and butterflies. I had my meds adjusted and even added a new med and over the course of a few weeks I stopped having them. Anyone else deal with this? I'm bipolar 1 with ptsd and anxiety if it makes a difference. Tell me other people deal with this.\n",
      "I spilled to my female friend A I find her friend B cute. She introduced me to her friend and things were going well. Alcohol made me remember I was actually totally 100% in love with friend A who is actually married with a very nice guy. I spent the rest of new years eve torn between a shot at something real with a woman that was very interested and was nothing short of amazing and some decades old romanticism that will never amount to anything. Thanks, alcohol! Thanks, bipolar disorder! Hooray, 2020!\n",
      "Or does anyone have any advice on what to do? I can't be honest with my doctor at this point. He said the medication seems to be working well and my mood seems greatly improved.But nah doc, I just snort that shit...I used to be hooked on methamphetamine (*shudders*) so this replacement is welcome if I want a burning sensation in my nose along with the urge to do stuff.Now I don't have to worry about going and getting the stuff from the kinds of people I had no business being around in the first place.Meth is nasty stuff. My pussy used to stink like *nail polish remover*.Nope, nope, nope.Don't do meth.\n",
      "I'm so tired. I had so much fun yesterday (I was sober), talked a lot and to people I don't know, laughed and felt strong euphoria. It felt almost like I would have been on drugs. Now I just want to sleep, just daylight hurts my eyes but I have to move all the time. I feel like I want to cry but just can't. Why it can't be just normal sometimes. I've felt normal last year for 2 months, rest of it I had manic, mixed or depressed episodes\n",
      " I'm posting this here because I realised that my bipolar has been the driving factor behind so many poor life choices. I'm hoping the input of others will help me avoid making another.I'll post a short summary of my problem first and then a longer back story for anyone who is interested.I  am currently doing a masters degree in computational neuroscience. I am  thinking of dropping out because I want to work in quantitative  finance. My current degree will go a long way to giving me the  programming skills I need for quant finance, but I could equally well  pick up those skills on my own - there are tons of resources.I  could continue with the degree, finish in October, do some interview  prep and begin the job hunt. Alternatively, I could drop out now and  start all the prep I need to do immediately. I estimate that dropping  out will allow me to finish all the job prep about 4 months earlier.So will gaining a few months be worth it? Should I stick with the degree and finish it?I'm not short of money at the moment so that doesn't need to be considered.I'm looking for input on this because I'm not in the best place mentally right now. I'm really anxious so I'm tempted to drop everything I'm doing and run. I realise that this is not the best instinct so I'm hoping other people can provide some insight.BACKSTORY:I  have an undergraduate degree in physics and maths and a masters by  research in physics from a lowly-ranked university. While doing the  masters I got involved in financial trading, both manual trading and  algorithmic trading. I convinced a friend of mine to do all the  programming while I did the strategy design. We only had mild success  but it definitely counts as hands-on work experience. I wrapped the  project up when my friend decided to get a new job and my old graduate  supervisor convinced me that I have a future in physics and should  pursue it further.I then went to  do a taught masters degree in theoretical physics at a very prestigious  university in the UK. The job market for physics is so rough you kinda  have to go somewhere prestigious to improve your chances. I started  doing the degree and... all hell broke loose. Holy shit did my mental health problems get ugly. It was like the stars aligned to create the perfect storm of every mental health problem at once.  It got so bad I had to take a year off. Things were better when I came  back, but they still weren't great and it reflected in my grades. I  passed everything but I didn't graduate with distinction. This matters a  hell of a lot for doing a PhD but less so for getting a job in  industry.At this point I said  fuck it, I hate living in the UK and moved to Portugal. I knew literally  nobody there and had no work or study plans. Sometimes I suspect my behaviour  was mania since the decision was so impulsive and I spent so much money. I lived in Portugal for about a year (this was in 2018)  until I started having panic attacks that got so bad I had to leave  since I didn't have access to proper mental health care where I was.Once  I left Portugal at the beginning of 2019 I started to suffer from  depression again. It was too severe for me to work and I eventually  ended up in a mental hospital. By the end of my stay in hospital I was  desperate to do something again. I was convinced that not  workingstudying was a major contributor to my problems so I looked for  something to do. I gotta be honest, I did not pursue all of my options  diligently. I said yes to the neuroscience degree because they responded  to my application quickly and I just jumped at it thinking it was gonna solve everything. Right now I think I'm an idiot for even thinking about doing a 3rd masters degree, but at the time it seemed like the best possible decision.Don't  get me wrong, the degree is interesting stuff, but I don't think that's  justification enough. It could turn into a PhD but I don't think it's a  good idea to spend years doing that when there is no way I will be an  academic and it won't help me for the job I want.Any advice would be appreciated, please don't let my mental illness make all my decisions for me.\n",
      "So yesterday was crap. I saw a doctor for something totally unrelated to BP, and he and his resident treated me like a keg of psychotic powder that was just about to blow. (They get to see all your medical history.) This, when the resident was sitting there in a filthy lab coat and could have passed for a Bad Self Care Day on the Closed Ward poster boy.Last night was crap and I had to pull out every skill in my book to stop myself spiraling further into some self-destructive shit. But I did it and eventually made myself get to bed. This morning I woke up shaking convinced that I was going to kill someone (who depends on me and doesn't deserve it at all) and that it would be much better to kill myself first.  I talked myself down off that one, and took something. Then I scraped my ass off the stairs where I was sitting freaking out and made myself get moving. I know I'm not going to kill anyone. I know I don't have to kill myself. I don't know why this has to be so fucking hard but I know that for some reason I fought back today and I'm going to keep on fighting. I am not letting my brain fuck me over like this.More power to us. We can do this. We are better than this shit.Happy New Year and may the force and the right meds be with us.\n",
      "I have ADHD and bp2, most of the people that I have met with bp also have ADHD. I had to take adderall this morning becasue I felt like I was gonna lose my mind if I didnt (i normally dont take it because it aggregates my tics), and I forgot how much calmer and more mellow i am on adderall. So, I was just wondering if theres a trend with these two, or it's all just a coincidence? Do many people have the two?\n",
      "Hey I burned myself 12 times with cigarettes today and am thinking about suicide a lot more than normal, should I go to a hospital or try to stick it out?\n",
      "So, it's 2020 and I'm still alive, somehow, after two suicide attempts, three years of suicidal thoughts, two years of self harming, five hospitalizations and three years after my bipolar diagnosis. I also have been diagnosed with anxiety, an eating disorder, and PTSD, but I feel like bipolar disorder has been the most dangerous of those.If I would have been told at 15 that I'd still be alive in 2020, I'd have been shocked. Same if I'd been told at 16 or possibly 17. Life seemed hopeless then and I was sure I'd have taken my own life by now, but I'm not even suicidal anymore. I'm still struggling though, but at least I'm alive.\n",
      "Last week I decided that I couldn't keep taking daily medication. It wasnt a choice I came to lightly. And it was not a surprise to my immediate family. I said a lot of hurtful things. But despite the fact that these people have known me my entire life, my family called the police and stood around talking about me like I was not there. I was very there. And I can still hear the things they were saying. And I can still see the way they acted towards me. I was removed from my home, but later allowed to return, without being involuntarily kept longer. Very obviously, there is a lot of healing going on right now. It wont be finished for some time. I'm staying off the meds, with the support of my spouse.All of the other relationships that were affected by this, I really don't know about. My parents, friends, law enforcement. So there's that.\n",
      "Happy birthday to me... (insert depressive episode here) Thanks bipolar2, how did you know this was exactly the gift i *didnt* want?\n",
      "Hey idk if anyone has experience with stopping wellbutrin. My psych just told me to stop 150mg xr  if i don't like it. The only caveat it that I am just about at the end of the first script. So I have been taking it for just about 4 weeks and am fairly adjusted. I faced incredibly uncomfortable symptoms when I started it and then evened out around week 3. I thought it might be a good thing but my cognitive ability still seems pretty impaired. While on it I am still pretty severly depressed and have suicidal thoughts quite frequently. I am feeling real spacey a lot of the time. I think it is because I am losing sleep. I don't seem to rest properly I am always really hot at night and would really like to sleep good for just a single night. I was doing ok on just trileptal but I figured I would try wellbutrin to try kicking myself into proper gear.  Now I think I will go back to just trileptal. No regrets now I know I am not missing out on anything. I just don't know what will happen now that I am getting off it, I want to avoid sever depression as I have a lot going on right now. Thanks, also any input on trileptal affecting sleep ? i just want to get to the bottom of this sleep situation.\n",
      "So for the past 5 months I just cant shake the feeling of anhedonia. All I can find effort in is lying down in bed scrolling reddit. Even watching YouTube is an effort for me. I just can't find anything that slightly interests me, even the things which usually do totally I don't partake in. I bought pokemon for my switch because i thought that might heal me but I play it for 20 minutes then get bored. Music was something I had a great passion for but now it's just something I can't listen to for more than 10 minutes before I come under the realisation that this just doesn't interest me any more. I'd get excited about new albums coming out and I'd buy them on vinyl and obsessively look at the album art and look at all the things which come with it before listening to it but now I can't imagine going over to my record player and putting on a record then getting up to put on the other side.Hell everything seems like a massive effort to me. I think this has something to do with me taking time off work since I was hospitalised in August. There's no split in time when I'm not at home or at work so I take no pleasure in the things I used to look forward to anymore.  I'm going back to work in 2 weeks and im almost excited to go back because maybe then I'll get better and I won't be as isolated as before but I'm scared I'll freeze up at work and get worse in my depression.Has anyone else had experiences with anhedonia and has gotten past it? Could it be to do with the meds? I feel like I've not enjoyed my life for the past 5 months and it's starting to take a toll and I'm scared I'll never get better.Thanks for reading!\n",

      "So basically I went to a bar last night, didn't drink or smoke but I had some caffeine and I got home at like 2, took my meds. Then I fucking couldn't sleep so I took my as needed sleeping pills. And I slept for 4 hours. Now I'm concerned that this may trigger an episode. I don't feel high right now, but caffeine and lack of sleep usually trigger a hypomanic or mixed episode for me. Anyone else have similar experiences?\n",

      "So I have bipolar disorder and ADHD. My doctor prescribed a low dose of adderall for my ADHD because I am stable on my meds for bipolar. Unfortunately, the adderall sent me into a hypomanicmixed episode and I have had to go off of it. I have to trade having ADHD for having a stable mood. I had been so irritable on the adderall, blowing up and having meltdowns over stupid stuff and also having suicidal thoughts. I am doing much better since I am off of it. The only problem is my ADHD is back full blown, and although it doesn't impact my relationships as negatively as the mania, it is still difficult. I forget things, am very distractible, can't focus on things that people say to me. It is so frustrating. I just feel so dumb and like my brain is totally fucked. Wasn't sure if I should post this in the bipolar sub or the ADHD sub so here I am.\n",

      "I started feeling symptoms a week ago and it's only gotten progressively worse. The last two days have been nothing but anxiety and mixed episodes. I attribute some of the anxiety to the the cold medicine. I have to return to work tomorrow and I'm fucking terrified. Can anyone relate?\n",
      "I think drugs can be a pretty great thing. Some of the nicest memories I have happened on drugs and I do think that psychedelics did indeed further my horizon. That being said: Drugs must be used in caution and moderation. It's kinda useless to tell this to bipolar people, most I know do it anyway, but you've probably all heard that weed is supposedly pretty bad for someone with this condition. I still do it. A lot. I don't think it necessarily affects me negatively - I've been slowly getting my shit together - for the most part - even while smoking a lot. Anyway... A few days ago I thought it would be cool to get some Ecstasy to take with friends on New Years. I did have initial concerns. Bipolar is a chemical imbalance, right? And I assumed that a drug that famously gives you all them *spicy* serotonins and dopamines would probably go on and continue to fuck that imbalance by several magnitudes. Anyway, after a bit of consideration and asking some friends for advice I decided to just do it. *\"Just stay hydrated, don't drink and have a good nights sleep afterwards, don't take too much - Start with half a pill and only do one max.\"****LOL***As I mentioned the pills were originally meant to be taken with friends on New Years - Well you know... All my routines and daily rythms tend to completely collapse during holidays and taking meds is a routine and I started to take them irregularly. I still get episodes, even with the meds, but they are usually rather limited in their intensity since I started medication.But that night it hit... *it hit hard.*So there I am... About two hours after completing the acquisition, sitting on my bed, completely shitfaced manic.*A bit wouldn't hurt, would it? It'll be fun and if I don't take too much it'll still work on New Years, right?*Let's just say that manic me isn't great at restraint.14 pill? Down with it.*OH WHAT? Already half an hour. I don't notice anything, maybe take that whole half and boost with that leftover 14 later.**Ohhh yeah... That's nice. But it could be better, right? Just a bit more.*It kinda went on like that for about 30 hours, until I had consumed a whopping 1.2g of mdma. All by myself. It did have it's moments, not gonna lie. I felt tremendous love and beauty in everything, I melted into the Universe - I could not tell where the end of it began and where the beginning of me started. Music was *in-fucking-credible.* Lights were beautiful, the damn stars. I started to hallucinate. I would see objects, whole buildings jump around. The glow of my cigarette would move up and down, accordingly to the frequency of the music. I was in bliss.But I just could't have enough. I couldn't call it quits and the thought that I might be at a dangerous level didn't even occur to me. I took more and more and more. Eventually I started getting anxious, sweating like hell (I can't come up with a analogy that would do this justice), my heart felt like it was going at least 170bpm. I was shivering, I felt so cold yet I was so cold.Eventually things started to normalize and I got some sleep. Might've gotten myself some nice serotonin syndrome right there. At first the Hangover wasn't too bad and it only really started to kick in a few days later. I feel like shit in every possible aspect. I haven't been that depressed since a long time but it feels very different from a normal depressive episodes.I just thought I'd share this here, as a precautionary tale, of sorts. Moral of the story is: Take your meds, be careful when fucking with drugs. Maybe set an absolute max for certain substances and do everything to keep your manic impulses under control.\n",
      "I thought I was truly happy, for once. I had a sense of motivation I've never felt before. I was going to the gym, learning new things, trying to get more into programming and learning more languages, I was content with my life. That all drastically changed, and I don't know why. Now I'm at rock bottom. I'm depressed, my motivation is gone, I have no urge to do anything I was once interested in. I feel an overwhelming sense of anxiety and sadness. I feel like I don't matter to anybody. I feel like I don't exist, I'm just an afterthought. People don't truly like nor care for me, they just tolerate me until I become too unbearable. I don't talk to too many people about my problems. But I wish I did. I'm desperate. I'm desperate for help and attention. I just wish I knew that I mattered, and how much I meant to people. I wish I knew how my very few family members or friends truly felt about me. I wish I had reassurance, so these feelings would go away.\n",
      "I'm one 450 mg Lamictal, 1200 mg Trileptal, 75 mg Wellbutrin and 1200 mg Lithium. I want to to wean off of the Trileptal because it's not as effective as the Lithium and it seriously killed my brain for a while.               However, the first time I took Lithium it was a fucking disaster. I don't know what happened but it was insomniac hell on earth.              Now, ever since I've been on the 1200 mg Lithium I've been not only happy, but my ADHD is actually improving. I think the Lithium and Wellbutrin are working really well together. Every day it's getting a little bit better and my thoughts are startlingly coherent compared to a month ago.\n",
      "So I've recently come to realize a huge part of my manic and mixed episodes is hypersexuality,  by itself not awful right? Except its resulted in 3 unplanned pregnancies in the last 8 years all with damaging ends to myself (if you're curious no I am not raising any children ) so today I made an appointment to get on birth control for the first time in a decade so I can stop fucking shit up when I get that way!

      "Hey guys. Last night I experienced a weird symptomstate that I really haven't felt to this degree before. I was sitting in my car around midnight, had a terrible night prior, and just needed to be alone for a minute. But I just did nothing for like 2+ hours. Like, I wanted to go home or to a friend's place, but my mind was effectively blank and could not muster any willpower to... Do anything? It's kinda hard to explain. My brain just wasn't working or something. I could move and speak, but didn't really do either thing. Looking online the closest things I found were avolition and maybe some depersonalisation, but the avolition feeling was acute and wasn't like I didn't have the emotional motivation to drive, I just couldn't. Anyone experience anything similar?\n",

Psychiatrist and I recently discussed tapering it down since I was still experiencing somewhat significant depressionanxiety, so the last month I've been on 600mg. No problem.Lo and behold I oversleep (thank you, brain) and miss my last appointment before heading to my parents for a month for holidays. No worries, I think. I have some 450mg lying around that I can take for a few days until I ask my doctor to call in a refill to a local chemist.Turns out shame about missing the appointment is too strong to email my doctor; I ran out of my 600mg two?? weeks ago and have been taking 450mg. I've been having trouble sleeping, feel like I'm constantly on the verge of crying, super spaced out, trouble remembering things, exhausted like I have super low blood sugar, and generally like my mind is out of my control and cruising to paranoid anxiety-ville with nothing I can do.I have 2 tablets left and then I'll be on nothing for a few days. Did finally email my psychiatrist today but she's out of office for the new year.Does this sound like withdrawal stuff or is it just me handling family and holidays really badly?\n",

      "So I'm on T, and I was in a lot of pain from my acne last night. My dad came into my room. He said as a father, he notices all the chemicals that go into my body(I take 5 different psychiatric medication and T). He brought up how it made him sad to think about the stress I'm putting my body through. He knows I have no choice but to be on them and feels for me because of that fact. “When you are done being a chemistry experiment, will you live past thirty?”  He's totally right. So this got me thinking and made me worried as well. My body is under a shit ton of stress. These pills we all go through, what tole are they taking on us? This disease kills and I understand why we need medication. It's intensely important. But what happens when the dust settles. How long can one person survive on 5 different psych medications?

      "I was diagnosed bipolar. I have just learned some disturbing truths about my families issues around mental health. Mostly learning of suicides by cousins after being diagnosed with mental health issues. Its hard to process and I just feel a sense of grief for these family members (even though I never personally knew them). But their stories are tragic and heartbreaking especially since they completed suicide. I'm scared and I dont know why. My suicidal thoughts and ideation have lessened thanks to some meds, but learning this just makes me frightened. I didn't know these things and I'm now 30, unemployed, and living with my parents. The worst part is right now is that one of my parents thinks that if people want to kill themselves than they should just do it. 😰It makes me literally sick.I found this disturbing and it makes me want to cry because I don't feel that I would have a lot of support if any from my parent if I ever had to be hospitalized again for suicidal thoughts. I guess I just don't know how to process what I feel is cruel. I'm not sure why I am posting this..

I don't want to be a burden, I don't want anyone to waste a single second on my pathetic life but I just don't know what to do and where to go. It'll pass. Maybe someone has some nice words. I'm sorry for this mess of a post but I don't know.\n",
      "I'm so very tired. My heart is broken. My mind is buzzing. I don't want to do this anymore, but it's only just the first day of the new year. I wish I had someone with me who would take the responsibility of making me take my morning meds off of my shoulders. If I could just have that, it would be perfect. Alarms don't work because I snooze them and forget. The short term meMory loss on meds is no joke. It absolutely happens.\n",

I want to end it so bad.  But at the same time I don't.  Mainly because of the pain it would cause my family.  But they don't understand the pain it is causing me....I feel like I'm in it too deep to go back at this point.  I can't picture my self ever happy again.  I don't know what else to do besides end it.  I need help but don't know where to turn.  I have a psychiatrist and therapist but I can't be honest with them because of a state monitoring program I'm in....it's a long story but it has to do with my nursing license and a previous suicide attempt.   I'm lost and hurting.  I want it to stop.\n",
      "So I haven't seen a dentist in 4 years due to me being constantly being put in long term pysch wards but I finally made it a year of no episodes or needing to go to the hospital and I want to get my health back on track and I've mostly done that besides go to the dentist. I'm going to the dentist tommrow and I'm embarrassed. My teeth aren't bad but deff aren't where they should be because of how depressed I've been and not taking care of myself. I don't know if I should mention to the doctor like briefly why my teeth aren't great or just say nothing. I just know it's gonna hurt my confidence when I hear like o you got a cavity or something or you need a tooth pulled idk. I'm proud of myself for finally going back to the dentist and trying to take care of myself I just don't want to look bad to the dentist. I feel shame and guilt for.not taking good care of my hygiene because I was depressed and suicidal. Ugh what u guys think\n",
      "hey i am a first time poster on this subreddit. I haven't had an episode in a few months but last time I was manic and did some really shitty stuff because I had stopped seeing a therapist. I had not gotten an episode in about 6 months which is good for me. I was okay until my fiance moved last month and I have no contact with him for 3 months (not a break up). I can't even get myself out of bed most days. I quit smoking like 5 years ago but i smoked like half a pack yesterday and got so fucking drunk after 3 years sober. I am plagued by insomnia I get an average of four hours of sleep per night but last night I got two hours. I am so bad at recognizing my depression but I can catch my mania so quickly. My family denies my diagnosis so I second guess my feelings so much\n",
      "I have made my peace with the fact that no psychotropic medication is considered safe for pregnancy, and therefore having a third natural child is not in the cards for me. My husband and I have seriously discussed adoption anyway. However, I know my medical history will be examined by agencies, and I attempted suicide in 2012 when I was unmedicated. Has anyone here adopted a child despite having bipolar disorder? Was there any complication to the process?\n",
      "*sorry for my English my first language is French*I hate this. Can't seem to keep jobs for more than a year or two, I leave whenever I'm not good there. For example I used to have a really good job at a bank since March 2019 with great insurance. When it got bad mentally I impulsively left and got another job, but hated it so I'm back at the bank.  I've lost my insurance rights until I get my place back. I leave when I'm at my lowest.  Also, I'm 22 yo, I have debts because of spending money I don't have, and with my job I should be able to live well but it's not happening :(I feel alone and embarrassed since everyone around me is stable in almost every way and nobody gets me, so I hope that at least someone have been through the same thing or similar to me\n",
      "I'm M, just turned 30, been bipolar type 2 since I was 19. It's been a ride, that's all I can really say. I take it day by day now.I woke up hungover from the 6 White Claws I drank alone last night. I'd usually drink cheaper but it was New Years. I almost bought cigarettes too last night but the old ladies in front of me in line were taking so long I just left. Blessed. I didn't need to relapse.I made an elaborate protein heavy breakfast, OK not elaborate but I know nutrition and it hit the marks. I went semi-hard in the gym, probably would've gone harder if I wasn't hungover. Then I did all sorts of productive shit alone all day because I am a loner.That leads to now. I got a bottle of wine, I finished it. I ugly cry. I think about how if the guy that interviewed me for a new job a few days ago doesn't hire me I'm gonna do something crazy. Like threaten his personal safety because I take his not hiring me as a personal affront, a judgement of my character and that I am not good enough. I mean, he's right. I was coming close to committing suicide this week but my parents threw more money at my life because they can afford it but act sparingly. I'm drunk. I wish my parents would've just let me fail, and stop bailing me out. I can't do this alone. I'm so lonely and depressed. I'm a fit 6'2” white male and haven't kissed a girl in 7 years because I have no confidence. I just want to die. I wish they would've just let me die so I could've commit suicide with dignity. But now I have to fight to succeed again, and accept rejection after rejection followed by pain after pain.\n",
      "This may be a little long so bear with me but I really need all the advice I can get. Ever since I was 89 my psychiatrists knew I was bipolar however wasn't officially diagnosed until I turned 18. I have done the whole in and out of institutions, getting off my meds in a manic state, etc. but I would say for the most part I was pretty stable this fall winter season which usually is my worst time of the year for depression. I have a newfound anxiety trigger which is health anxiety regarding my mom, and myself. I am constantly thinking and freaking out about dying and either having a heart attack myself or my mom having one.. its draining. Now heres where my main issue comes in, I stopped taking my medication about a week ago because I get in these funks where I \"forget\" or tell myself \"I can skip a day\" all because I am lazy and dont want to get up and take my pill. It caught up to me and im super depressed and anxious about dying now on top of feeling like life isn't real because im dissociating. Is there any advice anyone can offer to me, as a young 20 year old whos disorders keep on getting worse as time goes on? Im struggling here. Thank you for ur time!!\n",
      "I'm currently on 150mg of lamotrigine, I just went up on my dose last week from 100mg, I was also prescribed Zoloft for the first time. Ever since last week I've been really itchy. It's not a rash it's pretty much just itchy especially on my back of my arms, arms and legs. And mainly I'm just kinda scared of the “deadly rash” they warn you about but it's rare right? At first I thought it was the Zoloft because I started getting itchy right after I took the Zoloft for first time ever (but also it was the first time I went up to 150mg of the lamo) so I quit taking the Zoloft just thought maybe that was it but it's been a couple days since I've not taken the Zoloft and I'm still itchy : like I said it's not a rash or I would be going to the ER, it's mainly just red in some areas I've been scratching but not what I would call a rash. Is this something I should be concerned about? Or is itching something that happens once you go up a dose for a bit? Before this I've not had any side effects of the meds just when I go up my dreams are really vivid for a week or so. If you've read this far thank you so much lol\n",

      "I'm new to the bipolar world, and I have been taking Lamotrigine for about three months now. I've noticed my sex drive has gone WAY down.

Is anyone else struggling with a low sex drive? Any suggestions?\n",
      "When I was 14 through 16 I was at the lowest in my life, I would self harm with broken pieces of glass. I would sleep all day and all night. I isolated myself from all my friend. Until one day my mom caught a wild, injured, cat. She caught the cat outside of her work with a giant metal cat trap. She brought the cat home to treat it for a little then give it to out local no kill shelter. I have to say I am so happy that the shelter didnt accept him because he was basically deathly I'll at the time. This cat was in rough shape and there were multiple times that he could've died. We kept him in the bathroom for him to adjust and to keep him away from our dogs. I would spend so much time with him, I was basically his nurse at the time.We named the cat \"keanu\" and I had no idea at the time that that he would completely change my life. Once keanu was all better (there were many scares about his health) he started to explore more.He didnt easily open up but I was the only one he trusted (which I guess is normal for siamese cats) once he started to feel comfortable he really made him self at home. Now 3 years later, keanu is my best buddy. He is the most vocal cat that I have ever witnessed. He always wants attention and wants to cuddle. It's like he knows when I'm sad and he always puts a smile on my face when I'm feeling low. He made me feel like my life finally had a purpose, and it was to stay around for him. He has helped me so much and I feel like hes the only reason I'm alive today, hes my best friend. TL;DR: Mom brings home almost dead cat. I nurse him back to health, and he becomes my best friend. Hes gotten me out of the most depressive episode I have ever been in and I owe him my life.\n",
      "I'm a two-time combat vet, I served in Iraq (Al-Anbar) for a year in 06-07, and Afghanistan 09-10 as infantry in the Marine Corps. Since I got out of the military in 2010 I have always been good because of my insane drive to do things \"right\" or OCD as the Dr puts it. But I just can't find any consistency and it makes suicide seem like a viable and practical option at this point. I genuinely don't know how to be a normal person anymore, I've had good \"starter jobs\" where I destroy myself working my fingers to the bone and everyone around me says they want to promote me. It always comes crashing down with extreme anxiety I hide from other people, 2019 was the worst year of my life and I'm sitting here on new years eve thinking, \"do I really want another year?\". In 2019, I got divorced by a wife who cheated and then got an abortion without telling me, had to quit my job because she wanted to live in a place we could only afford on two incomes, and paid off the rest of the 6 months remaining on the lease by eating nothing but tortilla's and peanut butter while working at McDonald's and living on the floor of my old friends house. I used to have such energy to start over and get motivated about the next big thing. While I was working at MCD I got promoted to shift manager and my strange and bad communicating boss(genuinely I think her anxiety kept her from being capable of reassurance or straight forward communication). She always said nice things and told me what a good job I was doing but, the more I worked the more it became me picking up just a little bit more of everyone else's job until I was working to the point of being drenched in sweat every single night ( I managed the overnight). I did such a good job in fact, that when an employee called out or the shift before me left a huge mess it started to give me panic attacks because I was 100% positive I wouldn't be able to deliver the results I was normally capable of. During this process I found out I was diagnosed with pancreatic cancer. It wasn't the kind of thing where the doctor said \"you arent going to make it\" but hearing the big \"C\" word when you already have diagnosed PTSDAcute anxiety disorder, and are stressed beyond belief in this kind of job while sleeping on the floor because you are still paying off debt from a divorce you didn't want was \"it\". I just couldn't take it anymore, so I quit and came home to my parents farm while I got treatment, I am cancer free now post surgery by 7 days and I genuinely can't find it in myself to start over again. I just want to give up on life because it feels like a cycle of try hard and do the right things and wait for some non-existent god to answer prayers for stability, I look around and realize I genuinely am a good person who wants the absolute best for people around me. Then I struggle to ever find anything that takes the edge off so that I can not be freaking out as the pressure builds and gives me chest pains. What is life and why do I have to keep doing it?\n",
      "Warning: slight hint at abuseToday I went to the OBGYN to see why my cycle was 8 days long even tho ive been on HRT for 3 years. She diagnosed me with endometriosis and suggested I get an IUD. She said it might hurt and I wasnt too worried because I have a high pain tolerance. But... The minute she touched me with her scope, a switch flicked in my brain and I went into fight or flight. My ptsd caused me to have a severe panic attack and it took them 3 attempts to put it in because I was screaming and panicking so much. I made the realisation that the last time I felt pain in that way was in a VERY low point in my life. So lesson learned: ask to be knocked out the next time someone has to put anything down there!\n",

      "Hi there everyone, remember that tonight and many other nights in they year will have the shiniest trigger of them all, fireworks. Bit of advice on how to handle them: Don't ask people to stop them (it won't help the situation and you'll probably regret asking later on), if you absolutely can't handle it then put on some headphones and listen to something catchy (helped me get through some rough times in Afghan), and for the long term, try to get used to being around them. As long as I'm aware they're coming I can condition myself to not acknowledge them, thanks to exposure therapy. Remember to keep someone available to contact if needed and get something to eat and drink. Stay safe and happy new year.\n",

      "How do you work out your triggers with multiple trauma? I'm only up to my second session (next Thursday) of REM Therapy to treat my first and worst sexual abuse experience. I've seen four different Psych's now and have finally been diagnosed for REAL by my fifth. I have an actual name for what I've been dealing with! It's been so long that I figured once I knew what I was dealing with, it would be easier to cope and manage my triggers. But I still have a really hard time managing. I'm so easily startled that I get angry over the smallest shocks or noises or feelings. I have no idea how to deal with this sudden flood of emotions that I just want to go home and go to bed. I did used to resort to recreational drugs and alcohol to cheer me up every now and then, a night of excitement to look forward to you know (awfully unhealthy), but just didn't have the moneyenergy to do that anymore. (Probably a good thing considering turns out I had a Tonic Clonic seizure) sigh of course I have epilepsy. I don't even buy marijuana anymore which was always my go-to but I haven't been able to afford it in the last 6 months and trying to manage my mental health myself (it's hard sigh) I'm trying everything I can to work out what's triggering me and when but is it supposed to get easier? Have you worked out yours? Did it take long either before or after getting a diagnosis? Do you find more now still? Do you find ways of calming down and how often do they work?

Ive been married for a year now and it seems like no matter how hard I try to communicate to my husband what I go through, what my triggers are, and the way I feel when I'm having flashbacks or am anxious in certain situations he doesnt get it. Does anyone have any resources ( books, lectures, anything really) to help partners of abuse victims understand what we go through and how to be supportive? Thanks 💖\n",
      "I don't know what I'm trying to gain from posting this, I think I just need to talk about it. Maybe hear similar stories. I've been trying to not talk about it too much to my friends and family because it was traumatic for them, too, and I'm sure they're sick of hearing about it. I'll try to keep this as short as possible but I know it's gonna be long. I apologize in advance. I was in a pretty bad accident on Christmas eve night, and I've been suffering badly from it, mentally and physically. My mom was driving me back to drop me off at my apartment after we were running some last minute errands when a guy runs a red light and t-bones us. He was going over the speed limit and didn't see us, so he didn't brake. I saw the headlights coming from the corner of my eye and screamed but my mom didn't have time to react. His mini van hits us right on my door. I, unfortunately, didn't have my seatbelt buckled like I normally do, but it's not a law in our state. It happened exactly like it does in the movies. In the seconds before the impact, I just expected everything to fix itself. I expected the car to just stop. I keep replaying that moment in my head. Especially when I'm in the car now and I see headlights coming through the passenger window. The window shatters on me, the airbag goes off, my door caves in on me. Everything goes red then a pale orange. Our car spins what feels like a million times and when we stop everything smells like smoke. I hear screaming and it takes me a while to realize it's me screaming. My mom gets out before I even realize we've stopped moving. I can't get out, my door is caved in. I feel like the car is going to explode and I can't do anything. I'm sure that I'm going to be set on fire. My whole face feels wet and I notice blood dripping onto my jacket. I can't open my right eye. Maybe I was just too scared. I don't know. My mom pulls me out of the car from the drivers side. From the sounds of it, there were a lot of people watching. Two people help me walk to the sidewalk and sit me down in the snow. They try to get me to stop screaming. One woman, who I later learned had medical training of some sort, got a clean towel from her house and put it over my eye. Her daughter was on the phone with 911. She was trying to help me breathe but I was hysterical. I ask if everyone in the other car is okay. She says they're all okay, I'm the only one bleeding. At the hospital, they take two pieces of glass out of my eye, right below my eyebrow. By some miracle, all I have is a concussion, the stitches from the glass above my eye, lots of bruising and some cuts from the glass. I'm gonna be out of work for 1-2 weeks. The general consensus is that I'm very lucky I didn't die. I have lost about 6 of my old classmates to car accidents alone this year. On one hand, I do feel lucky. I should've been in worse shape. On the other hand, to be honest, most days I wake up, I wished it killed me. I feel like I'm trapped in my own life now. Being in cars now is suffocating. I feel like I'm trapped in a box underwater. Loud noises, the smell of smoke, seeing headlights, walking too close to the road, the sound of car horns. Fireworks. Doors closing too hard. Everything scares me. The drives to my doctors appointments are excruciating. I think about what it might've been like if I just died. I feel completely out of control of everything. I obsess over everything I can't control now. Natural disasters, house fires, accidents of any kind. I don't want anyone to leave my sight because if I can't see them in front of me, then I don't know they're safe. It feels so unfair this guy just got to rip away my peace of mind. I've become so preoccupied with control. What I can control, what I can't control, what others around me can control. I have PTSD already, from childhood abuse and a sexual assault that happened two years ago. I also have OCD which is probably responsible for my new obsessive thoughts. Maybe it's dramatic. My injuries are minor compared to what could've happened. But I feel completely broken. I want to stay positive but I'm really struggling with the idea of this being my reality forever. This has destroyed me in a way I could never describe to someone who hadn't felt it.\n",

      "I was walking to my truck with my daughter, her best friend and my dog. Drunk guy turns onto my street as we are leaving to go to my partners place for NYE.He was racing around my neighborhood in a huge, loud truck with a camper shell. His truck was loud. Like, brought the neighbors out loud. The kids are 5th graders. He nearly slammed into my truck where the girls and my dog were. There were 3 trucks lined up behind me and he got closer and closer to the them as he flew down the street until he hit my neighbors work truck knocking off his side mirror. I called the cops and I was not the first to do so. He had hit TEN cars already. TEN. This was 6pm. It was only barely no longer light out.I had been standing in the road about to get into my truck. If I hadn't run for the sidewalk he absolutely would have hit me. I absolutely would have died. He was going *at least* 50mph. I have previously been hit by drunk driverstexting drivers, all of which were traumatic, causing PTSD that I'm getting therapy for, but I never thought I was going to die before. I was absolutely terrified. I still am.The girls don't realize how lucky we are, and I'm glad for it, I'm doing my best to keep my cool around them but I am so stressed out. I let my daughters dad know that she may have a tough time with it going forward. I also called her friends dad and told him what had happened. Why are people so incredibly selfish?

      "Usually when people lie,  I just think less of them and walk away.   But when it's someone I have to be close to and am supposed to trust? I get extremely upset. My husband, of around 8 years,  is sometimes completely delusional.   He'll say things that are a complete exaggeration,  if I bring it up,  accuse me of doing whatever im accusing him of,  then if I try to ask him when he calms down he denies ever saying that and accuse me of lying.    Latest example is really dumb,  but for reference,  he insisted every time we go out to eat,  it cost one whole paycheck.   It doesn't.  He probably just misspoke...  but when I tell him that's an abserd exaggeration,  he says he never said it,   that I'M exaggerating everything.  If I can prove he's wrong,  he never apologizes,  only more angry sarcasm.  He also has this problem where he cannot have a conversation without screaming.   The louder he is,  the more right he must be.   It makes me so angry I want to die,   then I completely shut down and can't function for a few hours.   My brain goes almost catatonic,   no thoughts.    In more serious matters,   i sometimes lose my memory.   I can't remember what I thought about the situation before he was screaming,   I only know I thought he was wrong.    I feel like I should handle HIS (I'm going to call it forgetfulness) in such a dramatic manner,   but it makes me feel so alone in the world.TL:DR My mind needs to heal and I need a rock to anchor me to reality.   When he does dumb stuff like misrepresentat facts, I can't handle it.     Any advice?

      "Yesterday I went to work like any other day. I was called into the office shortly after which made me anxious. I was sat in a corner of the room with two of my bosses facing me. That's when they asked if I was under the influence. I said no that I'm usually just tired as I don't sleep much. They asked why if I had any medical reasons they can have noted. I told them I have carpal tunnel and they suspect I have fibromyalgia. That I often wake up with joint pains. That wasn't good enough so I told them I had ptsd at this point I'm in hysterics. They asked if I wanted water, one boss left to get me a bottle, and the other pressed why I had ptsd so I told her I have abusive parents and was raped by my cousin. I went home crying. When I returned for my purse my chest got tight n I couldn't help but feel overwhelmed. It's been about 24 hours and I keep randomly crying I don't think I can return tomorrow.\n",
      "I (m 33) have no real support system for my emotional problems. So sorry for bringing them here. But writing down how I feel and what is going on has helped a lot. I've been dealing with severe negative emotions, (stress, anxiety, fear, disgust, anger) pretty much 247. Also with severe  flashbacks. I beat myself up all the time.On the outside things are going well and better than they have been. But on the inside I'm all numbing and I have a hard time even identifying the different emotions. I'm still hanging on to hope that I'll feel a little more in my own skin with more time. I quit drinking, cigarettes and drugs (I smoke pot) 13 months ago. The drinking by far has been the hardest and longest to get back to normal from. But I'm starting to see that I've had these problems all along. I think I'm severely more stressed from giving up the alcohol and suffering badly for the long time. So I've been trying long walks, maybe getting back into school and other things to try to break some of my fears to be more functional more of the day and week. It's been a lot of new work to stay on top of things and be with myself and the now 247. But nothing has broken my odd, fragile sleeping schedule, my energy in the day gets depleted by 5pm, the fear and social anxiety takes a lot to overcome 247 and I should be able to fit more in my schedule without freaking out and not being able to keep up. So I guess outpatient treatment for my ptsd is a good idea. If I keep ignoring the root emotions and what caused my trauma so long ago, I'm not going to get over it. I have an assessment monday. I'm just hoping theres a waypath that will lead me to feeling more myself and in my own skin more of the day. It's taking all my energy to tolerate and get through the day. Thanks for the space to put my thoughts down.\n",
      "First of all  you're all weak. PTSD is a joke. Almost laughable as 911 and The Holocaust being real. You're all actors.You're all failures and should've been aborted! You waste of space lame ass virgins. None of you all could ever have your own place cause you're all too slobbish and would be kicked out for your pure incompetence and lack of life . Literally you're gonna die forgotten. You should be ashamed of this faked, photoshopped, filtered, embellished Aussie 'crisis' made possible by movies such as Mad Max and hired actors. At least the vegans will be happy cause all the extinct animals means people won't be eating meat but the grass is gone... If this fire was real, the best thing would be to throw all the refugees, foreigners, disabled, gays and trannies into the fire and have a Great Purge\n",
      "A few weeks ago I moved into a house already occupied by a couple, and was told it would be quiet-- but it isn't.  My flatmates are nice, but they are rough on the house and there is constant door slamming, stomping, yelling to each other, random people in and out. I thought I was way past this, but I guess I hadn't been back in an environment like this since my last traumatic incident. I don't know how to calm myself with the constant noise. I have just noticed lately that I am holding so much tension in my body and there is this heaviness in my stomach. I plan to move, but obviously cannot do so so soon after moving in. I just don't know how to make myself comfortable. It makes me feel like I am back at home and someone is storming around waiting to explode, or barge in and start screaming at me. The \"anger\" I hear in these noises has completely coloured my perception of other things they do and I have to remind myself that someone making a mess, or not being extra friendly is NOT a sign of aggression.\n",
      "Ill spare my personal testimony and dive right into thr point. I will,however, state that i have been diagnosed by a clinical professional as having ptsd. I was hesitant to post cause im kinda a recluse. Ive dealt with sadness and even anxiety mostly. But anger is new to me. I feel out of control when im angry. And the littlest most insignificant thing can fester into a boiling pot of rage or just instant explosions. Recently i had a really bad episode, so bad i bruised my inner thigh yellow and now my blood circulation to that leg feels worse. If a bloodclot eventually gets me than so be it but my main concern as of now is how it may affect my relationships and even moods of the few family memebers i have. Im worried i may have an outburst and say something i regret and ive also noticed that it tends to put everyone else around me on edge as well which isnt fair to them. Ive looked up tips but everything seems to suggest advice for what to do after you RECOGNIZE you are angry, which is not so easy when in an episode. So tl;dr Does anyone know of any good ways to even remember to do these anager managenent techniques andor other suggestion.\n",
      "I ended my 2019 crying in a therapist's office and getting diagnosed with cPTSD after being raised in an emotionally abusive  narcissistic household. I am currently at a loss. I'm looking for therapists in my area but none have called back. I have no clue what this diagnosis really means.I guess 2020 will be all about healing but this is truly not where I expected life to go. This year I'll probably be dropping out of college and moving to a cheaper town so I can try and build a life for myself. I probably won't be speaking to multiple family members anymore and never coming back to my hometown. So there's lots of change and things up in the air. I guess this is a rant or something but any sort of advice encouragement would be appreciated because I've got no clue really where to go from here.\n",
      "Im a student or trying to be anyways. Ive taken 2 medical withdraws due to depression, panic and sheer fear for my life. Im triggered by everything, crowds, people getting to close, new people, loud noises, walking outside my door. I know they wont be back to get me, but a part of me wonders and doesnt feel like its over.My 19 yo nephew has accused me of something that i cant believe. I havent seen him in years, a decade and my last and only memory of him was at a wawa when he was in high school when i asked him how his classes were. Than one day, him as nd his dad come to my house and not just accuse me, but assault me.I dont have any memories of my nephew as a kid, but if i get any information or a memory that i did hurt my nephew. I will kill myself. I was sexually assaulted multiple times growing up and if i ever put someone through that type of pain my life is forfeit.I just want to cry. I just want to be loved. My brother and sister hate me, my dad hates me, my grandma and grandpa are dead, my mom is the only one trying, but it isnt enough. I dont want people to hate me, to see me as a monster. Im a good person and do all i can to help people. Do i deserve this?\n",
      "So from ages 12 to 15 I was groomed by a woman and I sent her hundreds of NSFW pictures which she sold on CP sites. Every since then I have a deathly fear of young women around the late teens early 20s age. To the point where I dont let my 19 year old sister touch me or be in the same room as me. But today. Today was different, I let my sister hold my hand and I didn't freak out run away or cry I had anxiety the entire time but it wasnt a out burst like normal. My therapist taught me to associate my sister with trust and how she would never try to hurt me and I did that I told myself in my head all she is doing is holding your hand that's it. And it worked I'm so proud of myself I had to share it somewhere. I know it. Might be dumb to some but for me it was amazing.\n",

      "Hopefully not too tmi. My partner has PTSD quite severely right now (I have mild PTSD too). We haven't been intimate in months and it doesn't look like we will soon. Just wondering if other spousespartners go through this and how to encourage it when the time is right.\n",
      "Just have a quick question. Wasn't sure which subreddit to post this, so I just went with this since my friend is claiming complex PTSD. Anyway, my friend recently told me that her grandmother used to molest her when she was very young. When I dug a bit deeper, she said something about her grandmother repeatedly treating her for possible UTI's after she'd go swimming. She mentioned other behaviors her grandmother would do to her (that were admittedly creepy), *however,* I'm not entirely sure if she was really abused or not.It seems that her grandmother was medically treating her, but she claims that the grandmother would penetrate her when applying medication.  She claims that she would scream and cry and beg her not to do it. She also mentioned that the grandmother asked her to not tell her parents, which, yes, seems like an obvious tip off, but I could see why she may not want her parents to know, because it might make it appear just as the situation sounds.  Although... wouldn't the parents be responsible for treating her UTI's first?  I asked her if possibly her parents were aware (to feel her out to see if they gave the grandmother an OK to treat her UTI's), but she said her mother flipped out one day when she asked why her mother didn't put medicine on her like her grandmother did. It appears the mother didn't know and was quite angry, but she didn't say what the father's reaction was (it was his mom, so maybe he did give the OK and just kept the mother in the dark?). So I suppose that's my question: am I being a shitty friend for not believing that what she went through was sexual abuse? It seemed medicinal to me, but I dare not challenge her on it, for obvious reasons. I just wanted to run it by everyone here. Therefore, what constitutes sexual abuse towards a young child? I mean, if your kid needed an enema, would that be considered abuse? No, right? So would a grandmother putting medicine on a girl's genitals for repeated UTI's be considered abuse?  She said her earliest memories of this happening was around when she was 4, so maybe her memories aren't that accurate as well?\n",
      "I'm not going to do anything like suicide or crimes or any of that— but I want to disappear. My pain is a source of pain for others. To them, my pain is a judgement of their actions, their likes, their vices. Every single person I've had any kind of friendship or romantic relationship with looks at me, in my pain, and starts to think I think less of them.Maybe I do. I don't even know— the thoughts are so hard to keep track of; it's like a foggy mist of misery inside my head where only feeling is clear. There's no language.I won't go into the cause of my triggers, but I will detail that any intoxicant— recreational or addictive drug use, by someone I like or care about, tears me up. I just spent 3 hours lying in bed in the dark because my girlfriend mentioned a marijuana pipe in a reddit post, and I happened to see it. To her, it's so insignificant that she forgot she even wrote it. To me, it's the end of my world. I am so sick of all this. I just want it to end.\n",
      "It feels unbearable. I was sexually abused and forced into prostitution as a child and it took me so many years to get out of that situation, and now it's like I can't stop reliving it. The nightmares I have when I sleep are so terrible, people who have slept next to me before have told me that I move really violently in my sleep and mumble things like the words 'no' and 'stop' and sound like I'm in pain, and waking up from them is always the worst, sometimes I'll wake up in the middle of hyperventilating, thinking that I'm going to die and it takes me ages to calm down and be reassured that I'm somewhere safe, other times I'll feel so shocked and sick to my stomach that I'll just go to the bathroom and throw up. They're always so vivid and that's what I hate about them the most, it feels like I go right back to that place again every time I go to sleep. There are times where I don't sleep for days just to avoid having one and it's so miserable, forcing myself to stay up for such long periods of time, but it's all I can do. Sometimes I don't eat for days too because I feel so sick from it all and don't know how else to deal with anything. Flashbacks are the worst, sometimes I'll have days where I just have one after the other and it feels nonstop and like I'll never get out. It makes me feel helpless and paralyzed, like I can't move or speak even after it's over. It's so scary because I'll get stuck in these states where I'll be going through everything again and I can't get out of it, and all anyone else sees is me dissociating and rocking back and forth, sometimes crying, and it probably makes me look completely insane but I can't control it, they just hit me and I can't stop it and I don't know what to do. Sometimes I genuinely can't separate what's happening from what's not and it's so fucking scary, I feel like my life is just one big flashback and nightmare sometimes, I'm so busy being thrown back into my past and having to relive it over and over that I hardly get to take in the life that I currently have. It's so hard. Surely I can't live like this forever. I was diagnosed with PTSD at 14 but it got super bad at the beginning of 2019 and just has not stopped.Please tell me things will get easier eventually.\n",
      "I've been suffering from traumatic episodes that get worse by the day. I've accepted what happened to me and the events that occurred but there is one thing I can never accept and I can not even believe.... Backstory: I was in a severe car accident that totaled my truck, shattered my femur, and fractured my hip. The truck I hit was parked in the middle of a two lane road going one way, in the middle of nowhere with no street lights for miles. For awhile I didn't think anyone was coming to help and I was pulled from my truck by the other party. After laying on the side of the road for x amount of time, a car pulled up, a cop got out and started talking to the 3 people who were from the other party. After they were done talking, they all approached me laying on the ground, the cop shined a light in my face and started to ask me questions like why did I hit them trying to make it sound like it was my fault but the truck didn't have any lights on and it was parked in the middle of the road while the men i the other party were doing something in the woods!! Regardless, after the cop asked me some questions she realized I wasn't at fault and I was coherent, which is when this night took a turn I never saw coming and I am still struggling with the reality of. After the cop was done questioning me, she handed her flashlight to one of the guys from the other party and told him to keep it in my eyes so I can't see. Meanwhile she walked to her cruiser, pulled it closer to me and she went into the trunk of her car and the next thing I hear is one of the guys saying you don't need your gun because we can just use his gun (referring to me). Luckily I heard her say no we are not killing anyone as she walked closer to where I was laying. Next the female cop tried to ask me questions and I refused to answer or acknowledge her, which is when she pressed on my leg where there was an open wound I sustained. I screamed in pain and she tried to tell me she was there to help. Next she told me to look at her but I told her no because I knew she was just gonna shine the light in my face. But she tried to assure me she wasn't going to do that and she wanted to see if I was alright, so I lifted my head up to look at her and as my eyes tried to adjust from a flashlight in my eyes to the pitch black night, the cop hit me in the head with her gun and knocked me unconscious... This is where my PTSD stems from. This is why I have no faith in society or law enforcement and this is where i can barely believe this happened. I mean a cop hit me in the face after I just experienced a horrific car accident that wasn't my fault!! Cops are supposed to be held to a higher standard but they can choose to operate at that level or lower when convenient for them. To make matters even worse, the female cop put the investigation onto another cop just so she didn't lie under oath if she got a subpoena. Still to this day I don't know why she did it and I couldn't even tell anyone because I never thought anyone would believe me, especially since I cannot believe myself. 4-5 days ago I was having a flashback that lasted at least an hour before I could regain control. I went to my parents house to get some aspirin for my headache and that's when I had another episode in front of my father. During which I told him the truth about the fact that I can not stop thinking about my accident and what happened during my accident. The next morning he thought I was losing my mind but I assured him it was the truth and he immediately called a lawyer. Now I can't stop thinking about my accident. Flashbacks and thoughts are more frequent than ever before however I have found a slice of peace in telling my family what happened. I see a therapist tomorrow but I doubt anyone can help but I need someone to help because my PTSD has messed my life up in multiple areas and I need help with it. How do I stop flashbacks or crippling thoughts of pain that I experienced? How do I put this in the past and leave it there? I mean I've accepted the reality of the situation that people do stupid shit that leads to other people getting hurt and the dumbass people are immune to prosecution because they have a family or friends in law enforcement and unfortunately law enforcement controls the narrative of an investigation and apparently they can just choose to not confess the reality of a crime, when they are held to a higher standard!  Clearly the justice system is broken for multiple reasons but this experience affected me to the point of changing my career path to being a politician or legislator so I can enact laws and regulations that eliminate biased cops from a potentially bias situation. I would also make them take an ethics course yearly because no cop should be unethical no matter the situation. I have so many emotions running through that I can't stop thinking about it and I want to!\n",
      "So I'm 17 F, and I think I might have PTSD and will very probably try and consult a therapist about it sooner than later.So, I've never liked to drive, I've always been scared and stressed about it and thought I wasn't ever liking the feeling of controlling a deadly weapon. But, I live in a region where there's only common transportation in the bigger cities and so, my parents still wanted me to have my license. I've failed my theorical test to get my driver's license 2 times before succeeding the third time. I've failed 2 times the practical exam and still not practiced for the third try, that I still haven't scheduled.The thing is that I was involved in a car crash back in September as my father lost control during heavy rain and we hit the rock on the side of the road. Happily, the impact happened on the back of the car and we didn't have any injuries or felt any impact. But still, if we had hit the rock on the side or front, it would have been way way worse. So, I've been terrified of either being in a car, especially when there's rain snow slippery road and I panic very easily. And so, I've also been terrified of driving.  So, dear redditers, I'd like to hear from you, either being your story or an opinion :)\n",
      "I have been having the same conflict with my partner for awhile now.  4 years ago I was with someone who assaulted me with a kitchen knife and strangled me until I blacked out. That was just what ended our relationship but it had been 2 years of physical, sexual and emotional abuse. I have terrible flashbacks, and triggers, and they usually go on through the night. I live in the basement of my mom's house now; it is the only place I feel safe enough to live. My boyfriend now is a wonderful guy, but he really wants me to spend the night with him, at his place, and I am really terrified to go there right now. I have too many nightmares and flashbacks and am not wanting to have them anywhere else but my mother's house. I think my boyfriend is getting frustrated, and I wonder am I overreacting?

I should have just told her that seeing his face again would bring back terrible memories but I thought that it had been long enough and that I'd be okay talking about it now, I was wrong. I haven't been able to sleep more than a a couple hours a night for the past couple days, does anyone have any tips on tricking themselves to fall asleep?\n",
      "It took me so many years until late 2019 that my parents were abusive. I suppressed so much emotional, mental, and sexual abuse that happened with my stepdad. It took much time to talk to peers and my boyfriend to discover that I was sexually abused for years. For years, I was manipulated into uncomfortable and even sexual situations, and if I refused, I just worsened my stepdad's depression, out of guilt, I would do things so he could stop sobbing or drinking. The worst thing I discovered was being mentally manipulated that being naked in front of your parents was normal (implanted by my stepdad), and it was drilled in my head to the point where it was normal to me. I never felt so disgusting, gross and extremely uncomfortable in my lifeMy mother was so authoritative, I was sheltered as a child, and I never had the opportunity to go out with friends. I was actually going insane at one point because I stayed in that damn house for 17 years. If I ever tried to leave would constantly guilt me of being a \"terrible child\" and \"didn't appreciate the things she does for me\" or she'll say she doesn't love me anymore all because I wanted to leave the house and be with friends or have a boyfriend, (mind you I was 17). Every time I didn't like her strict parenting style, it was an act of defiance for her. She destroys my self esteem and tells me I don't deserve anything. She's also a psychopath when it comes to people that want to help me out. Because I'm her daughter, no one else should take care of me except her. Now that I'm in college and away from them, I noticed that my parents are awful people. I don't talk to them now, and my mental health has improved but there's still a lot of pain to deal with. 2020, I'm going to seek for help, hopefully get a therapist, and get proper diagnosis. 2019 was a shit year, but 2020 won't be.\n",

      "My PTSD stems from repeated sexual abuse from different abusers starting at a young age (6) and parental ; caregiver abuseneglect. I had SEVERE androphobia (fear of men). I feel like I had worked very hard and mostly gotten over it, until I started working a \"legit\" job.Holy moly.Literally every other (sleazy!) guy at work hits on me, in predatory ways, and it triggers me into panicflight. (I mean predatory like, they only approach me when nobody is around, find me on social media when I don't tell them my name, harass me verbally. They discuss sexual acts with me when I tell them I'm not interested. When people are around, they act like it never happened and I'm crazymaking it up. Then continue to harass me privately and at unexpected times.) I'm becoming afraid to go anywhere. I'm scared to do anything outside of my house. And what's worse, if I report them, I'm the one who gets in trouble. Not them. They lie and say I'm making it up. Then my bosses bully and punish me because they think I'm trouble. I've even been harassed as a teen by college professors, like who does that? How am I supposed to go to college if I'm afraid the professor will try to touch me again? I was harassed at church by a creepy pastor, I'm not making this up. I luckily had witnesses to the pastor and the professor, so I know I'm not overreacting. I think I'm just plagued to attract the attention of awful people. I have 2 dogs, one I raised when I was in HS and he took on a guardian-like role to stop my parents from beating us both. He creates a barrier between me and anyone I don't \"ok\", including other dogs or cats. (I can also revoke the consent and he will separate them from me. I can even revoke consent for him to be near me, and he will willingly separate me from my other dog if I so wish. Imagine: a DOG understands consent better than the vast majority of men I've met.) The other dog I raised when I was being essentially held hostage in my house for 2 yrs, and he took on the role of emotionalmental service, like helping stop panic attacks or breakdowns. Both dogs stop me from self injuring or strange repetitive behaviors. I honestly do not feel safe going anywhere without my dogs anymore. When I'm out, all I want to do is go home and get my dogs. I know it's bad to be so dependent, but I feel so vulnerable without them. What in the world do I do? I can't just bring my 2 dogs everywhere with me and claim \"service\" and not get fired from my job. But at the same time, the constant stress from my job is now making me very ill. (I literally got pneumonia and almost died from self-neglect and fever! Great little hospital bill I've gotten for Christmas.)As for the next step, I'm looking into different jobs that I'd maybe be able to bring my dogs, but my health issues clash with almost every job that I imagine I'd be allowed to bring a service animal. (For example, a desk job would be difficult because I have a lower spine injury that makes it painful to sit. I can lay, and I can stand, but sitting hurts after too long. I'm more in the market for physical labor, music ; arts, animal care, those are my strengths.) It's really putting me down... I'm really starting to feel like there's no hope, everywhere is just dangerous and the world is no place for me. Every experience just validates the feeling... This was really just a vent, to sort of put my thoughts together to help me think it out, but advice is more than welcome. It's not like I've got any ideas, lol.\n",
      "I feel like every single aspect of my personality is affected by it. I have so many problems with regulating my emotions, which is affecting my personal relationships. I lost a lot of joy in things i usually loved doing. I am stressed and tired all the time and i get really snappy. I don‘t like myself like this. I plan to start with therapy soon and i hope i can work out some of my problems there, but i can‘t help but think, that some parts of myself are never going to go back to normal.Before all of this i had finally started liking who i was or at least who i was becoming. It feels like i‘m back to square one. Anybody else feel like this?\n",
      "Not getting into details aside from the fact that my PTSD is CSA-related. I never told my parents (that I remember, it happened when I was 5-6 and my parents have always treated me like a dramatic liar so maybe I did tell them and forgot)Last year (I was 25 or 26) my mother told me that when I was a child I used to be happy and curious and full of life, and that it suddenly changed \"for no reason\". I have no memories of ever having been anything other than a sad, sometimes angry child. She can be quite abusive emotionally so I'm not really sure what she wanted me to take away from that, it felt a little accusatory like she believes 5 year-old-me decided to become bitter just to flex on her.It reminded me of when I was 13 and I went to a doctor for my insomnia. After talking with her and testing a few things she wanted to talk to my parents so they came with me to the next appointment. he told them that there seemed to be no physical problem but from our conversation she could tell that I probably needed therapy. My father basically told her that I was a dramatic idiot who made things up for attention and we left.Now the trauma is resurfacing, new memories are coming and I can barely function. Not to mention the added trauma of having grown up without effective coping mechanisms and the abusive relationship I got into and stayed into because I didn't know I was a human being who deserved to be treated as such. I'm so angry and I can't stop thinking about where I would be now if they had allowed me to get help 14 years ago, or better yet 22 years ago when they noticed something had drastically changed.I don't know what I want by posting this, feels good to get it off my chest among people who can understand.\n",
      "&gt; The term Post Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD) has been associated with veterans since 1980, but existed well before that under different names. Only recently, first responders have begun to open up about suffering from it, as well. Across the nation, firefighters are dealing with symptoms of PTSD, but the stigma still persists.&gt; &gt; PTSD also affects local firefighters, who are beginning to talk more about it, even if only in the confines of their respective stations.https:www.wvnews.comwestondemocratnewsfirefighters-open-up-about-ptsdarticle_da9ca274-4578-50ed-a7e9-65cae3e36485.html\n",
      "&gt; Dear Editor,&gt; &gt; The diagnostic criteria for posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) have been reformulated and narrowed for ICD-11 [1] to six core symptoms across the clusters re-experiencing, avoidance, and hyperarousal.  In comparison,  PTSD criteria in  DSM-IV  consist of sixteen symptoms across three clusters, in DSM-5 of twenty symptoms across four clusters,  and in  ICD-10  of thirteen symptoms across three clusters. &gt; &gt; The new ICD-11 diagnosis Complex PTSD (CPTSD) requires symptoms of PTSD and in addition disturbances of self-organization: affect dysregulation, negative self-concept, and interpersonal problems. Impairment represented in the disturbances of self-organization domains is not necessarily associated with trauma-related stimuli.  CPTSD  typically follows prolonged or multiple events, but diagnosis does not require a certain type and frequency of a traumatic event...&gt;.&gt;.&gt;**In conclusion, the current  findings indicate that the  ICD-11 PTSD criteria are less sensitive than other diagnostic manuals and may not, therefore, identify all traumatized and impaired young people with high psychological distress. This might lead to restricted access to eligible treatment for some young people since ICD is mainly used in clinical practice. ICD-11 does not as yet provide developmentally  sensitive adaptations or wording of PTSD and CPTSD criteria, and this topic needs to be discussed critically. Furthermore, differences between diagnostic manuals  might lead to limited comparability of treatment studies and to reduced relevance of research for practitioners.** *Eilers, R., Rimane, E., Vogel, A., Renneberg, B., Steil, R., ; Rosner, R.

      "No matter what I do I can't focus. I read things over and over again but the words don't mean anything, I look at them, I understand them, but only as individual words, they don't make sense together.There's also issues of not being able to focus at all with background noise which contributes, and frustrates me.Is there anything I can do to help myself\n",
      "How frequently do “normal” people think about offing themselves?\n",
      "Someone I loved very much killed himself with a shotgun on st. Patrick's day 2019 and I am surrounded by pictures of him and his things in my house but at the same time I try to avoid thinking of him as much as possible. I can talk about him sometimes without letting myself feel it but it almost always comes out when I'm drunk (the crying and even hurting myself) I went to rehab because I kept getting drunk and trying to kill myself. I was in there for 4 months and now that I'm out I'm doing better at not harming myself but it doesnt hurt any less. I feel sick to my stomach when I think about him too much. The pain in my chest physically hurts so bad. I'm not that jumpy. I jump with things like fire works and sometimes when the phone rings. I was texting him when he didnt answer and I thought he got arrested or something but turns out he was gone. I called him 25 times in a row trying to make sure he was ok. I was the last person he talked to and I could have stopped it I know I could have. I got really obsessive and needed to know every detail after he died and his sister sent me the autopsy report so I know what he looked like. I think about him every single day and it hasn't gotten any easier and it's almost been a year. I get really freaked out when my friends domt text me back I immediately think they are dead. I was so so close to him but I think of course I shouldnt hurt more than  say his mother but sometimes I cant even function when I get in my moods. I never fail to being him up when I drink. I'm sorry this is so long its helping the pain in my chest a little to get this all out. Thank you for reading.Aslo I cant sleep if hes on my mind if that's important.\n",
      "Different cities means new environment, new stressors, new therapist. I have a fear of being judged, tho I know honesty (in theory) will help me manage my PTSD. Any tips to help my anxiety?\n",
      "It's such a weird thing to say and explain but every day I look at a stranger. It really hurts. I don't want to disassociate so much all the time. The grounding techniques have not worked over the last 2 years of trying. I need something new. -lake\n",
      "i just can't do it anymore and it's only been 14 months. therapy and medicine doesn't help and the only time i feel okay is when i'm high or drunk but i'm a mother and that's not acceptable at all. i can't even be a good mom because i'm too tired and angry and upset all the time\n",
      "this is my first post on reddit and im on mobile so I'm sorry if this is messy. I'm just really desperate for someone to understand. if i broke any rules I'm really sorry, I did read them i promise I'm just not the smartest. sorry for my terrible grammar also, it's very late at night as usual for me.  tws (all mentions, nothing graphic): csa, self harm and suicide ideation.My ptsd stems from csa and i was diagnosed late last year. I was the hospital at the end of 2018 for suicidal thoughts and I began remembering parts of my abuse. I have frequent nightmares and insomnia despite taking sleeping pills. I'm also in my last year of high school doing it online because of facing racism at my local school but that isn't important haha....because I'm at home alone all day every week I'm left alone with my thoughts and have given up on trying to do schoolwork, and even just basic things that people need to do and i feel pathetic.  the memories are so crippling that I've begun to self harm, and I've never done that before. I am in therapy but I'm just barely functioning. My parents even said they notice but don't do anything. I just wish someone could understand. I feel pathetic. I wanna run away from all this, even just for a week.\n",
      "I've found that after my traumatic experiences, it has greatly affected my life to the point where I'm not really the same person I was before and close friends are taking notice. I think I might have to explain to them why I'm so different now, but I dont want to be the person who rambles about their problems or is defined by such an incident. I also am worried that if I tell people they might see me as \"attention seeking\", hence why only 2 people in my life know.At this point I feel that I cant just tell them \"something stressful\" happened, as they are bringing a lot of bad memories back with the comments they make in their day to day lives towards and about me. Even if I wanted to tell them what happened face to face, I often get so stressed and panicked that I'm unable to speak, I violently shake and go into a pretty embarrassing state, and I dont want to put them in the position where they see me like that.What does everyone else do in this situation, and what would you recommend? How has everyone else dealt with letting loved ones know? I'd love some advice to make this go as smoothly as possible.\n",
      "I often times see posts asking if their trauma is valid. I sometimes wonder that myself. But I am here to say IT IS valid. Doesn't matter who or what caused it. Your feelings matter. Idk if you all heard of the term suffering olympics but it's when people who have been through something compare trauma to see “who has it worse.” It's very common in survivors. [I hope this helps all of you guys](https:psychcentral.combloglisten-to-this-if-youve-ever-played-the-mental-illness-suffering-olympics). God bless\n"

      "I started Cognitive Processing Therapy in October of 2019. Part of my intake forms was filling out a form called PCL-5 it has 20 categories, each with a minimum score of 0 and maximum score of 4. These are all added up to a maximum of 80, The Department of Defense who made this system to help quantify and view change, says that a total score of above 31-33 is worth looking into for PTSD. I before my therapy I scored a 5680. I am now about 4 sessions remaining, and I scored today at a 3680!!! I'm so close to being where I need to be and I'm so glad I took the risk to try it out. I'll definitely update everyone when I finish, I'm so excited! The only major categories scoring a 4 are all the sleep related ones unfortunately, but I've got a game plan to help me through that.\n",
      "I hope that I'm doing this right and don't offend anyone. I am currently working with a therapist, and not having any thoughts of harming myself or others.I'm trying to keep my emotions in check but not be too much of a Vulcan about things.I'm also going to ramble because I'm not a \"share your feelings\" type of person ordinarily and I dont know where to start or stop under the best of curcumstances.I'm also on the tail end of my anniversary cycle.Both of my parents had their own trauma; my father didn't make it all the way back from Vietnam and my mother was abused by her father and a friend of the family, and both of them loved to drink.Neither of them were big fans of their awkward and clumsy little bookworm.At xmas, we would gather in Florida, with mother's family and I was abused by multiple male relatives.I spent a lot of my life \"living in 3D\", by which I mean dissociation, depersonalization,  and derealization. Somehow, I've managed to be professionally successful (I work in IT Security), but I live in constant fear of losing my job, especially as I get older.I'm good at it, but I never feel like I'm very good.Big progress with the therapist,  but it's hard and has dredged up a lot of stuff that I pushed down deep.This year the anniversary was the worst it's ever been, and emotionally I feel like a child.I cry at the slightest provocation,  butI dont have any friends, no support network. I have a wife,  and our relationship is solid, but when she tries to comfort me its touch and I dont want to be touched of late.I've never really felt comfort in it.To me touch is, intimate in the bedroom sense.I don't have anyone that I can really talk to outside of my once a week with the therapist,  and I dont know what to do. I don't want to just sit in the house and play video games or do whatever alone.I keep hearing about this magical support network but I've managed to isolate myself almost completely and cant seem to make friends.\n",
      "Growing up I had a bestfriend. And we grew up like brothers, for a while I even believed he WAS my brother. But unfortunately life got too much for him. He and I were 13 and 12 (respectively) at the time of his death. He, a fee of our friends and I made a team. And were we lived hosted these little tenements. We would compete against other teams on subjects like, physical agility and mental strength. I was the team captain for two years and I pushed them to become the best. And we did. But I eventually had to step down do to it being too stressful for me. My bestfriend took the position instantly. He was the captain for a little less then a year and one day suddenly call me and told me to come over to his house. That's when it all happened. He told me that he couldnt handle it anymore. I was mad about something and began to storm put of the room when I hear a deafening bang and a thunderous flash. When I turn around my bestfriend, my brothers head was wide open.He had stolen his dads handguns from his closet and decided to eat a bullet. I didnt know what to do. So I ran home as fast as I could, washed off the blood from my back and my clothes. But I never told anyone about him. About how I knew that he had killed himself. Not even my parents. And how it's been 5 years, and I am 17 and I still dream about him. I still see him doing it over and over again every time I try to sleep.This is the first time I've told anyone. AnyTHING for that matter.\n",
      "I feel like it's not worth it anymore. I'm trying to put myself back together. I am going to start therapy in a few days.I was physically abused by my father my whole childhood and my ex.I just can't stop thinking on how to hurt them back. I won't, but I want to. They are so happy now. I blocked my ex but he was sending little messages to me through his posts to taunt me before that,concerning his new gf. I wish everyone knew what he did to me but I would look crazy. It's been a year and I can't stop feeling worthless and remember it. And waking up from nightmares where I can't even get away on my dreams.I feel like I'm just surviving and even that feels impossible sometimes.I don't know what I'm asking for with this post, I just need to feel some hope today.\n",
      "*Delete if not allowed*So, I've been at this new job just shy of three months.And the first month was great. They loved how good I was at a lot of things.But now I'm focusing on details. Let me back up. I work at a staffing agency. My job involves sending out on boarding paperwork, running background checks, scheduling drug screens, and then hiring them into the system once everything is completed. Part of hiring them in involves putting in peoples bank information for direct deposit.I hired a person in, and put her bank information in wrong. I missed a number. When I hired her in, her file got double checked. They missed it too.She got paid today, which is why we know something wasn't put in right.So I'm over here, sitting at my desk, in a complete and utter panic because I've been trying so hard to do this job right (it's my first office job, they know it, and I told them I have PTSD), and it feels like every time I get back up on my feet i'm being kicked back down again. Part of me is absolutely deathly terrified they're going to fire me for this. Part of me wants to pack up my desk and leave and never come back. I literally hate that this is my life. That every little thing \"triggers\" me with this  job.\n",
      "I'm so tired of having bad memory, it makes me feel so stupid. I've been watching the Star Wars movies with my boyfriend for the last week and I can't remember hardly anything. I get the basic plots but names and details are always lost on me. I have to ask questions the whole time and it's genuinely creeping out my boyfriend. He doesn't understand how I can forget a detail from 20 minutes ago. I'm just sad. I use to have great memory and now I can't even enjoy entertainment. I just feel like a shell.\n",
      "I am going through a breakup or break with my girlfriend right now. She told me I was going to break and that I needed to find myself because she thought I didn't know how I was. But during our relationship I had started going to therapy and got my diagnosis. I feel betrayed that she would leave when I just started to make progress with things. I was in a bad place because I was dealing with things from my past and I realize that I was trying to get her to communicate with me, as I was communicating things to the therapist. That put unnecessary strain on our relationship and I didn't see that till it was too late. I had found her with another guy early in our relationship and I tried to work through it with her. But we never really takes about it and later when I brought up to my therapist she suggested talking to her. I talked to her. And I found myself bringing it up more often because it never felt resolved. I was hurt that she lied and I felt like a tool at her disposal. After what happened I stuck with her and tried to look past it but it still bothered me. When she decided that she wanted to go on a break and then break up, I was confused on what she wanted and I still am. She told me I was gonna break and that she was tired of having to for worry for anybody anymore. And that made me feel like all the progress I had made this year didn't mean anything. That she didn't care about the fact I was trying to understand everything that happened. I was going to therapy, trying to understand all the lost pieces of myself and forgive my past. But all she saw was someone on the verge of self destructing. And it crushes me. I don't know what to do.\n",
      "So I'm part of a pokemon group in my local area. The last time I met up with them was almost a month ago now and during it I had a massive break down and ptsd trigger which led me to joining this sub. I haven't met up with anyone since and I'm really nervous... I just needed to get this off my chest.Edit: spelling mistake.\n",
      "I keep wondering about Lottery Homes for folks with PTSD. So often, people with PTSD are tapped in environments, homes and locations which either fail to support them or even make the PTSD far worse, crippling them.I'm tired of explaining to supposed professionals that for me being on a third floor and above makes my PTSD Better. Anything moving at high speed in my peripheral vision has me triggered. Small birds are the most common trigger as they flit past. But as they stay below a certain height to avoid predation, If I'm up in the air this trigger literally vanishes.  I'd also love to be able to emigrate to somewhere tropical. My PTSD is linked to Muscular Skeletal injury and chronic pain, and the only thing that gives me significant relief without side effects is high heat levels, generally in the high 20s centigrade (80 Fahrenheit) and preferably 35 centigrade plus (95+ Fahrenheit). In the UK winter I'm unable to afford the heating needed and end up trapped in one room with little option. It's insulting when yet again some supposed bright spark says \"Why not have a hot bath\" as if this bright idea is something people with PTSD could never come up with for themselves. I'd love to be living somewhere free from the patronising idiocy that seems to be at plague proportions and endemic amongst those without PTSD.   When I need an escape I often look for high rise accommodation in Tropical Zones. Panama City seems to be my best option. Often the changes needed to improve your life are not rocket science, but often others control your access to them. One guy who was living in a ground floor flat was pestered by birds flitting past. When he sought permission from the Landlord to replant the garden with plants that were Bird UNFridendly to drive then away the landlord went ape shit and accused the guy of Bird Hating and killing mother nature. There are well-known practices in using certain plants that birds can't readily perch upon to get them to locate to other places. One person who has to give permission can cripple you because of their biases and needs to be a control freak.\n",
      "I tried hard but I just cant thrive in classrooms, they make me very anxious, schools and classrooms are triggering for me, since they are environments that I have been traumatized in. I have a problem of focusing on what's around me, I have a wide and overactive peripheral vision therefore people around me especially the one I sit next to think I am staring at them and get uncomfortable around me.  I had to struggle with this nightmare for two years at community college, so I had to wear hoodies and wear my hair down to hide my peripheral vision a bit, it seems impossible to focus straight on the board without keeping and focusing on people close by me, I don't want to go another few years struggling like that, so unbearable.I had enough and just finished my associates which was a NIGHTMARE for me to complete. I struggled a lot socially people didn't like me,  I always looked visibly scared, I think I retraumatized myself throughout the process, it was like I was re-living high school again. I want to continue my bachelors online , at least that way I can learn on my own pace and plus I don't have to be around immature people and take a step back every time I get overwhelmed. I am getting a lot of backlash especially from my mom and people I tell about when they say I want to get my bachelor degree online, but they aren't my shoes and don't have to struggle what I go through and I have to do whatever it best for my mental health and right for me.I visited a four year college a few weeks ago when I was considering and the classrooms were even smaller and more cramped than the ones I had in community college, it was very hot and the buildings had narrow and small hallways, I felt trapped. I knew I wouldn't feel comfortable or see myself there and that convinced me to just continue online and find more resources to heal myself along the wayanyone else struggled like this too?\n",
      "I'm curious if anyone else with ptsd has ever requested flight accommodations, how you request, and what options are available? I don't have a service dog. I've traveled in the past and I do okay, but somethings might be helpful for me. Possibly pre-boarding could be a help, as crowds aren't my favorite. Anywho just a random thing I'm wondering about. If you have any experience I'd be interested to hear it. Flying with WestJet. I looked a little on their website, but I found it difficult to understand.\n",
      "I'll start off by saying this will probably contain a load of terrible language.Wait out for long drip about my life 👍My ranting starts with work today, since being back two days my boss pulls me into the office and asks if I'm seeing my therapist this year (since Oct last year I've been going once a week) I replied with 'not this month as I don't have the money but yes next month I will be going back twice per month' his reply to this one what got me started today he just says 'well HR has phone and said you can't take holiday for it any more as you use it too early in the year oh and I'm only working until half 5 so you won't be able to make the hours up anymore ( all of my sessions last year's I worked an extra hour each day to make up the 4 hours I miss with my session and travelling to and from) so if you go back to it you're losing 10 hours each month and there's no other options available to you.I've then spent the whole day trying to come up with ways to make this work for me, I've looked at changing my session time which isn't going to work as I rely on public transport which is a fucking nightmare in itself as I struggle with hyper vigilance even walking to and from the fucking shop, I can't legally do fuck all about it, I can't just not see my therapist because if I stop at the moment I'll slip backwards rapidly (for clarity I took 2 weeks off therapy because of money issues and almost ended up being signed off sick because I went back to square one) My only option is to look at my own transport which I only have a bike license and the cheapest I can find in my area that's reliable is £900! I currently have £2.50 to my fucking name until end of the month and even then I do not have that kind of money to spend straight off! I've looked at finance, I've looked and friends and family and I've even looked at a fucking payday loan and none are any use to me at all. It will take me around 6 months to save that type of money and I can't be out of therapy for that long I don't think my head can cope that well right now.I'm at my wits fucking end and I cannot take this anymore, I try to get my head straight, my life back on track and start saving money and not have to pay out too much but then life decides \"you know what prick, you aren't doing any of that so have this heap of shit to deal with you cunt\" it seems like everything's a struggle and the world is fucking against me every step of the way. And to top all of this off, I tried to talk to my partner about how all of this is making me feel like we discussed would be better than me being silently fucked off or in a useless mess on the floor, and the only response I got when they could be bothered to look up from their phone was \"I know\" or \"i don't know what you want me to do\" I don't want you to do fucking anything other than LISTEN for fuck sake! Is that so fucking hard or is your Facebook feed more important than the fact I'm near a fucking complete break down and at the point of giving up entirely? I mean fuck me yeah that woman has amazing eyelashes and yes that dog looks cute but give me more than just a sentence and maybe communicate a bit fucking more! That's it I'm fucking done with it I don't know how to make this right or what the fuck to do. Rant over and fingers crossed I'll get some sleep sometime in the next 24 hours.\n",

      "Hey all. Hope your day is going okay.I wanted to ask if anyone here has finished college or is going through college and doing okay with it while having PTSD? Do you have any tips on how to get by? I'm really struggling to even keep up with course work just cause this stupid brain doesn't function like it used to.**RANT  CONTEXT PART**So for basics, I'm having trouble remember even the simplest things like if I've eaten breakfast or not. I can't read anything for more than 5 minutes without getting distracted. I can barely recall what I've studied. Everything just sorta melds into the dreamlike haze. I know I studied but I can't remember anything from it.In terms of work ethic, I avoid stuff like a mofo. Even looking at a decently sized pile of work gives me a panic attack. I get to it after a while but that's after so much time wasted crying. I also get caught telling myself I'll never make it or that I should just drop out.It's really annoying. Cause I know what where I wanna be. I know what I wanna do. I know what steps I have to take to get there. But it feels like there's always a wall waiting around the corner that I didn't expect. I honestly wanna drop out and just work cause I feel that I won't ever finish at this rate.**ACTUAL QUESTION**So yeah, I was wondering if you guys have any techniques that can help deal with memory loss, work ethic, disinterest, panic attacks when starting work, and just the general feeling of hopelessness when facing work? Any work techniques and stuff?Thanks all for reading and maybe taking time to answer. Appreciate it.\n",
      "I need someone to help push me to seeing a new therapist. I lost my old one due to insurance issues, and need to sign up again. But I just haven't been able to make myself do it. I don't know if its fear, brain fog, depersonalization, or what exactly. I haven't been diagnosed yet, but I know what I experienced.Some back story I suppose.In February 2019, my wife had a meltdown following her revealing an affair to me. What followed were about 3 weeks of chaos and abuse from her. The short story is that, within about a week, she called me names, degraded me, gaslit me, made me feel insane, screamed at me, sexually assaulted me, emptied my bank account, and attempted to kill herself. All the while trying to convince me (her husband) to accept her new boyfriend in some sort of triad affair or something.I had to leave the city we were in just to feel safely far enough away from her. Not to mention she pulled a smear campaign and convinced our mutual friends that I was the one abusing her.I've been afraid and isolated for the last year, unable to feel safe or connected to the people in my life.I've been having nightmares ever since. Usually the dreams have something to do with the way she violated me, or made me fear for my life.Just last night, I had another. In the dream, I had run into a girl I had a crush on in middle school, but in the dream we were our current adult age. We were hanging out in some sort of bar arcade lounge place, with couches and and all sorts of casual furniture and such.Eventually there was a movie playing on a projector, and the two of us were just sort of cuddling under a blanket. For a minute, I felt very safe. The the dream progressed to kissing and touching. And all I could think in the dream, is that her skin felt just like my ex wife, and I started to feel scared. Then, she eventually starts touching me more sexually, and I felt scared the same way as I did when my ex wife assaulted me.In the dream, I started crying and told her to stop. She did stop, unlike my ex wife. I could tell that the woman in my dream was concerned, and had no intention to harm me, but I just felt disgusted and scared with any sort of intimacy -- even in dream form.I woke up crying. And I'm here on this sub now, still struggling to admit to myself that what I experienced was traumatic.I just need someone to message me every day and remind me to find a new trauma therapist, so I don't keep putting it off. I really need the push.\n",
      "I never asked for what happened to me, but at the same time I did not fight for myself until years later. I almost feel as though it's just happening all over again. I thought I made friends with a group of people who were introduced to me through a work friend. But...Lately I have just been reliving the trauma, and I feel completely dead inside and hopeless 90% of the time. I was invited to D;D sessions, but that all went to hell because I would drink too much and start talking too much about my feelingsthe trauma, and the work friend who invited me has said that I'm just annoying now.Like I get it, the games are supposed to be fun, but I was trying. It's why I showed up. Before this last incident happened my bf also broke up with me, and told me he realized he never really loved me, but only wanted to fix me.I WISH it was that easy to just get over myself and move on. But what is the point if nobody on earth will ever be able to truly value me unconditionally, especially if I can't even fucking do it? I feel like I am damned if I do and damned if I don't.Am I just a selfish fucking waste of breath? Nothing is helping. Talking to friends is bullshit, because oh my god, if I say too much, I am annoying. Meds make me feel like a zombie most of the time. Talk therapy doesn't do anything. Mindfullness doesn't do anyrhing. Positive thinking only last for 5 seconds. I feel like I can't even breathe.\n",
      "Over the summer, I had a life threatening pulmonary embolism that I almost died from. I was hospitalized for several days and then released and have been on blood thinners for 6 months. From this experience, I've had depression. I've had nightmares. I've had suicidal thoughts. I've had mental and physical pain. I've had to see trauma counselors and take medication. This will probably last the entirety of my life to some extent. I've been more than happy to share this experience with other people and spread the word, but I was told I can't say that I have PTSD, because that only belongs to people who served. I think that's absolute bullshit and that people can't claim a medical condition to one set of the population. For reference, both my father and grandfather served in the air force and support me. So what do you guys think?\n",
      "I am really invested in the whole scandal with the youtuber Onision because he reminds me so much of my abuser. I've been watching all of Chris Hansen's interviews with Onision's victims but I've noticed that they can be really triggering. I also have OCD and struggle with face picking as a coping mechanism, and it's almost a form of self harm. On multiple occasions I have found myself sitting in front of the mirror for longer than an hour picking at all of my pores after watching an episode of the series.I know it would be easier to just not watch them, but they pop up in my recommended and I am really invested. I know that if justice is brought to his victims I would feel some justice myself. Hearing that the FBI is on his tail finally after all these years gave me a high. I am seeking justice in this case that I know I will never achieve with my own abuser, so does anyone have any ideas how I can continue to remain invested in this without hurting myself?\n",
      "I've been through many different types of trauma. The most recent trauma is the most confusing, because I didn't act like a door mat, but he treated me like one anyway. Now, I have a friend who struggles with her own personal issues to the point she won't speak up. When she doesn't speak up she makes me feel like I'm some kind of loose canon who's going to aim straight at her. Over my several attempts to try and get her to speak I realize this is going to take time and patience. However, its making me feel like a monster instead. It brings back feelings of me when I would be in the car afraid of my Ex all the time, who inevitably snapped. So, its really causing me to doubt whether I was the aggressor or not if here it is yet another person too terrified to speak up despite me being calm and everything. I don't think I can be friends with someone who is just going to be afraid of me all the time either. Was looking for some thoughts on how to proceed. Its really making me feel like a terrible person. She's so afraid of me I have all these doubts going on in my head.\n",
      "Context: I am a victim of familial CSA, emotional abuse and a recent traumatic surgery which has triggered this downward spiral.6 months ago I was this happy, career-driven person. Now that this has all happened, I've realised and relived all my traumas and can't really ever seem to ground myself. I've put my career on hold and now I can only bring myself to work part time because of severe generalised anxiety. I am constantly depressed and the destabilisation has thrown all enjoyable activities out the window. I have no hobbies. I've isolated myself from everyone bar my partner and maybe 2 friends. My previously “loving and supportive” family no longer have those associations, as I've uncovered most of my repressed trauma stemming from them.I feel very alone and right now it really feels like I've ruined my life. I have no motivation for anything, and I am 100% dependent on my partner. It feels like I'm suffocating him, but it's the only way I can feel functional now. When I'm at home without him, I count the minutes until he comes home. Really I'm living a pretty pathetic existence and most of the time I just want it to end. I'm taking medication and am currently in therapy but I don't feel any better. I could really use some help.\n",
      "I do not know what to call this. Maybe sexual abuse tw but I do not know.Okay so my trauma is that when I was 14 (I'm 20 now), my best friend told me she'd attempted suicide and I was subsequently publicly shamed by a group of adults when I tried to talk about how angry I felt about it (they left my post up talking about how I felt for two and a half years as an example to show people how not to feel after your friend attempts suicide, until my counsellor forced them to take it down). This left me with A) a massive fear of people killing themselves and B) a massive fear of expressing anger in case it makes me a bad person.What I'm about to talk about IS NOT my trauma or PTSD. But I'm talking about it here because I feel like you're the only people who will understand my hypervigilance around it.So I'm part of an online community about animation, Disney, etc etc etc. There are quite a few adults around my age in it, interested in filmmaking and animation and stuff, but because it's about animated films and Disney, it would seem like common sense that the community should be safe for children and teens because they're the target audience of what we're discussing.Apparently not.For the past year or so there's been lots of tension in the community because of adults acting inappropriately with teens. One I'm going to focus on is a woman who we'll call Yellow. Yellow was originally part of one of my animation projects, but pulled out once she saw the new members I had invited in. She said to me that one of the members, she wasn't going to name who, had been spreading rumours about her. I was shocked and said I wouldn't allow any bullies in my project. Yellow then admitted to me that the rumours were about her, a 20 year old, being in love with a 17 year old. I got very uncomfortable because that wasn't what I was expecting, so I basically wished her well but said I wasn't comfortable discussing this anymore. Oh, she also asked me not to mention it to anyone else. A few months later, a user we'll call Orange made a call-out post for Yellow, and provided evidence. Yellow, a 20 year old, had been sexting and receiving nudes and asked to be friends with benefits from Orange, who was 16. Orange explained that they felt pressured to continue in order to make Yellow happy. The comments of this call-out post were littered with people telling Orange it was their fault and they consented to the entire thing. This was not part of the call-out, but I've also seen messages on a public chatroom in which Yellow, at 19, would make...very, very questionable jokes with Orange, who at the time was 15 about to turn 16. The public chatroom does not go back far enough for me to see how long this was going on for, but they're the kind of jokes that make you wonder if that's how they were talking in public what were they talking about in private.I was furious with Yellow and confronted her for lying to me. She had said they were rumours about her 'being in love' with a 17 year old, but that was not the entire truth. Yellow insisted this might be her fault but it isn't completely. I left it, because at that point my hypervigilance began to flare up and I was concerned for Yellow's mental health if I continued to confront her. Yellow left the community and was not seen or heard from online for a few months.Cue Yellow suddenly returning again, this time with her own call-out post for Orange. The entire basic point of Yellow's call-out was to show that Orange consented to the entire thing and also provided evidence that Orange talked behind their friend's backs, which....I'm still baffled as to why that was relevant because talking behind your friends backs is a pretty wrong but normal thing for a teenager to do and held no relevance to anything else. Evidently Yellow and Orange talked it over at some point and both made public apologies; Orange seemed to take half the blame for everything that happened. At this time, my hypervigilance went mad. I sat in my car having a panic attack and flashbacks thinking Yellow was going to kill themselves because I was angry at them. I apologized to Yellow saying I overreacted, which Yellow accepted. To try and be forgiving, I let Yellow back into one of my animation projects, but I was still deeply unsure about it and wondered if I'd done the right thing.When I told them, both my friend and my mum seemed unsure whether I'd done the right thing too. My friend told me a month or so later that her boyfriend's 20 year old brother was being investigated by police for having a 16 year old girlfriend. I realized then that what Yellow did was really illegal and sent them a polite message saying I was sorry but I didn't think it was appropriate for them to be part of my project anymore, expecting that to be the end of it and they'd just accept it. I was very surprised when Yellow then came to me in a private message asking why I had kicked her out. I explained that considering her previous inappropriate relationship, I thought it was best to let the dust settle before I interacted with her. I was concerned that by letting Yellow in my project, I'd be showing other minors that adults can do these things with them with no consequences. Yellow told me I was rude, I was more worried about my own reputation, and I was mistreating her.That was all a year ago. I still panic thinking my anger could tip Yellow over the edge and prompt her to kill herself. In an attempt to protect the teenagers of the community (because there are more adults scattered around who have also engaged in illegal acts), someone considered making a list of people that minors in the community should avoid for their own safety. I told them I'd support them if they made the list. I do not know if Yellow will be on it. I do not know if she deserves to be on it.I got hardly any sleep last night. My hypervigilance has just been going nuts. I'm terrified of someone killing themselves because of me. Because Yellow asked me, all the way back then, not to tell anyone what she originally told me, I feel extremely guilty even writing this out. Like I'm betraying her and if she kills herself it will be all my fault.\n",
      "When my ex left me, she made me promise I would spend time with people (mostly a group of friends we met through Pokemon go we both got close too) and I agreed. It's 4 months later and I don't think I can do it anymore.The last time I spent any time with them, my ptsd was triggered really badly that led me to joining this sub and meeting some nice people. I spent the day with them today and it was all a bit too much for me and I've been feeling that for a while now.They don't feel like my friends, they feel like mine and my exs friends but now she's gone I feel like I was dumped on them. I would much rather spend time by myself than meet up with people no matter how lonely I get because I just feel worse after meeting up with them. In the end I just want my ex back in my life really. She made things better, she made me feel happy.\n",

Because I want the right kind of dog I wanna be as specific and honest with the shelter people as possible but I also don't want to burden them with my trauma.So what do??? I dunno. Help?\n",

      "My PTSD is from CSA, emotionally and physically abusive parents, and an abusive relationship I stayed in for way too long. These are things I only ever discuss with my closest friend, and it's still extremely rare.But sometimes I'll be talking to acquaintances or casual friends and I let a milder incident slip. For example the other day I mentioned how a guy from the local scene had assaulted me, because it was relevant to what we were talking about. My friend gave me that wide-eyed, pity-filled look and it was only then that I remembered that it wasn't as light an event as it seemed to me.I hate how my heavier trauma desensitised me to the rest, it's like my whole scale of what's acceptable is off. Plus, I'd love to be more mindful of what could trigger others, instead of mentioning an assault like it's just a detail in a story.Anyone has that too?\n",
      "As the title says, I had a very traumatic childhood due an abusive father that was alcoholic and every day my house would become a battlefield that I felt I had to survive to.This happened almost daily until I was 16 that I left that house to never see him again.I'm 26 now and I have very vivid images of the memories  I have from back then, even from when I was a little girl, I can remember it like a picture. I don't have flashbacks per se but I can get stuck remembering the same moment for a bit.I also tend to have vivid dreams and sometimes have nightmares where my dad is the protagonist and wake up crying.Any insight on it would help loads as I always tend to brush it off, my family and friends don't really understand it and it can be difficult to talk about it.I do not want to be diagnosed but I've been dealing with it for so long that I downplay it constantly, just keen ears and opinions will be really appreciated.\n",
      "I'm in a long distance relationship so I can only see my boyfriend if I stay at his house or he comes to mine. His family recently impulsively adopted an extremely poorly behaved dog. I'm currently at his house where she has completely scratched up my skin, had bitten my toes and one finger so badly it's swollen, and purposely targets me and jumps on me all the time. Because of what happened to me, I'm terrified of anything or anyone who has previously done physical harm to me and every time she comes near me I sit there shaking. My boyfriend doesn't handle her well because this is his first dog and she only attacks me, not him so he doesn't feel the need to put her in the crate until he's the one being targeted. Tonight was the final straw for me. She was completely calm laying across my lap then suddenly starts growing at me, attacks my arm, jumps on top of me while I'm hunched over, trying to shield my face, and continues trying to bite me until she's dragged off of me. A half an hour later I'm still shaking and crying because it brought me back to how I felt when I was assaulted. Everyone seems to think I'm overreacting, despite knowing what happened to me so I told my boyfriend that that's it. I cannot come back to his house until she gets better obedience classes and stops attacking people. Am I overreacting in the moment or do you think this is completely justifiable? He's frustrated with me for making that decision and I don't even know what to do anymore. I'm sick of being attacked over literally doing nothing but this would mean I don't get to see him or his family as much.\n",
      "I've known I have PTSD of abandonment since early September of last year, but I just very recently worked up the courage to let my mom know.I don't fully know why I was so reluctant to let her know. I think it was partially fear of being judged, and partially a worry that her knowing that I have PTSD would make her feel bad; she did everything she could for me growing up, and watching me after my dad left and then again when my sister left was very hard on her. I'm a very private person, and now that she knows, I'm not 100% sure how I feel about it (the only reason I even feel okay posting here is because it's anonymous! haha). She took it pretty well - so I suppose I should chalk it up to a success. Should I go about telling other people now? Is it necessary, or to my benefit? Or am I better off with people not knowing?If you read this, thanks 😅\n",
      "Scared and confusedSomeone in my family a cousin who is exactly one year older than me was the person who assisted me when we were little and one day I finally told him stop. We work together and he showed no signs of that behavior at all.It's been like 10 years and he's at my house for a family gathering. He was acting normal and I noticed him trying to get closer to the back of me not bad close but it made me not comfortable and scared cus of the past so I was very alert. I stayed to see if he would do it again if I moved and he kinda did stand behind me (maybe 3 feet away each time.) so I left the room and have been keeping away from him.

      "I just finished a human sexuality class that I am taking for my psych minor in school. I really enjoyed the class despite the hard work and the time crunch (it was an intersession class, so the whole 15 week course was condensed into 3 weeks).However, the other day I was doing a homework assignment that asked us to decide if the given scenarios were rape. I was immediately uncomfortable and when I got to the 4th scenario, I had to take a break and calm down because it was nearly the same situation in which I was assaulted Today, I took my final exam, and because it wasn't comprehensive, a lot of the questions were about sexual assault. Some described situations, but others just talked about the reactions that people have after experiencing sexual trauma.It really triggered me. Having to identify the different stages of reactions post-rape made me think of my own assault and it was just too much. I did manage to pull myself together, and I still got an A on the exam, but I feel so emotionally exhausted and just plain upset.I'm frustrated because it's been a while since I've been triggered like this, and I know I've been making progress, but I'm sad I'm in this place again, especially since I know to expect that I won't really be feeling myself the next couple days.If it were an in person class, I feel like I would have been better prepared and that I could have spoken to the professor privately about my concerns, but because it's online and because it's the last day of the class, there isn't really much I can do. I just need some kind words right now.\n",
      "I told her about my assault today, and I think I made a small breakthrough--or at least, I think there's a sign of progress. Usually when talking about it, I would say that \"I was assaulted,\" but today, for the first time, I said \"he assaulted me.\" That's a good sign, right??\n",

After my rapes all sounds became amplified due to hypervigilance, well it's 4:34 am where I live and I was mostly asleep (finally) and I hear a knock at the door, and my dog starts barking. It sent me into a mild panic attack, and now I'm laying in bed refusing to even stand up or make any noise. I hate being so afraid for my life all the time.\n",

I was back in seventh grade, picking up the food off the ground. I didn't go get another and I don't know how I ended up in the bathroom stall but I did 😕 So a fun day at school, it's been weeks and I'm still anxious about the whole thing, wondering if I'm going to get in trouble when clearly I'm not😩\n",
      "This is my first post so, sorry if there's mistakes. But its 6am as I'm typing this, i couldn't sleep and i just.. Felt like i had to get it out. Anyway. I was raped back on August 2nd, 2019. And.. It happened after i fully recovered from my previous trauma, there was maybe two weeks or maybe even less where i just... Finally felt at peace with myself.. I didn't hold any self destructive anger towards my abusers anymore i just.. Let it all go. I was finally back to being \"normal\" again after being... \"Different\" for... Most of my life. I always had a promise to myself that if i was ever raped again i would kill myself. So after i was raped during 2019 i was.. Completely broken. I didn't want to call it rape because i couldn't... Deal with myself if i \"let it happen again\". I get nightmares about it often and the day before i had another nightmare and it was of me.. Taking back my rapist after he begged me to. I get scared when i see red cars, because he had a red car. I don't like crucifixes because he had a crucifix above his door when he raped me. As dumb as it sounds, i don't like the store Target anymore because that's where i met him- and he told me he goes there often. I'm petrified of seeing him again. I might see him again when i start college and i can't talk about this to anyone in my life. Every time I've tried they've.. Ignored me basically. Or they tell me i deserved it. Either way it's not pleasant and i feel like I'm back to step one of recovery. I always wanna wear shoes that make me appear taller just so i feel safer and i never want to forget my knife at home because of the need for self defense. I want to change my appearance so drastically that he wouldn't recognize me if for some reason our paths crossed again. Part of me wants to be everything he loathes just to spite him and because.. It is truly just who i am. I want to heal so badly i don't wanna take another 5 or more years for recovery. I don't think i can make it till then. Don't know if i can be that success story. I feel like a lost cause. I feel all alone in this world, and i feel exposed everyday. I just want my armor back, i want to feel secure and carefree like i did during that brief time. I wonder if I'll ever get better from this. It's even more rough because everybody thinks I'm fine, and i hide my emotions well i suppose but.. It's like i drop hints to people and they just.. Still don't see it. They think that just because my outward appearance is \"better\" now- that I don't have any inner issues anymore but, I'm on the verge of breaking down in public everyday. I'm holding on the best that i can. I don't know how much longer i can handle this without any help.\n",

      "I used to have an extremely lean, athletic and muscular body that I had compliments for during all sorts of sports. My athleticism was peak, and although I definitely had some ED mentality and bumps along the way, I felt I had achieved a relatively healthy relationship with food(although definitely not with self-image or my body.) However, after personal events and a sudden change in environment, I, already battling depression and crippling anxiety, became very isolated. As a result, I really only had social interaction at school and at the gym. Instead of focusing some of my attention on my body and exercise, I began to focus all of my energy on it. Gradually, I moved into a routine extreme fasting and increasing my training regiments out of a fear of letting myself go. Feeling trapped and isolated, I began clinging to food as an escape, but out of a realization at how much I ate at a time(I've always eaten a lot), I gradually cut down my portions and restricted food, resulting in an obsession with my daily self-prescribed feeding periods. Despite eventually returning to my previous, healthier environment, the coping mechanisms had already set in, and I found myself unable to break this obsession with food and exercise. Worse still, I found I wasn't able to get a gym membership at the new local gym, and therefore felt that I would become fat and out of shape over Christmas break. This belief and obsession with my feeding periods lead to continued weight loss and overexercising. Physically, I withered myself away until I was nothing more than a husk of my former self, and I knew things had gotten bad when my family started to get calls regarding my appearance. Basically, it hit its peak roughly two months ago, at the beginning of February, when I was threatened to be sent to the hospital if I didn't eat. Something inside me internally snapped, and I began binging on every available food for the next few hours until I felt as though I was going to vomit. The next morning, I woke up with perceived energy and motivation, deciding I was going to \"have a healthy relationship with food and exercise.\" However, this turned directly into another binge as soon as I started eating. Despite every attempt I've made, I can't seem to stop binging at every meal time, although I've recently gotten to a point where I can stop long before I feel sick after eating. However, I can't stop eating large volumes of food. At first, I had perceived energy return after beginning to eat these large amounts. I assumed, then, that I needed to push myself to work out and stimulate muscle growth in order to bulk back up to my former body. However, gradually, in the last two weeks, I've become more and more tired, and all I see is that I've gotten physically fatter AND weaker. I'm still eating large volumes, but nowhere near as much as when I first started eating again, and I'm still exercising, but I feel weak and tired. Am I overeating? Did I try working out way too soon? Help? I'm currently seeing an eating disorder occupational therapist, but she's trying to help me psychologically deal with what mentally triggered my original ED. Now, I don't know whether I'm just exercising a lot less because I'm so depressed it's physically sapped my energy, or if there's a more medical reason. Happy to specify more  info if needed!\n",
      "I'm not sure if this is the correct place to be asking about this, but hopefully someone here can help me out. As of the past couple days, I've lost any desire to eat. I get hungry, but anything I try to eat (even things I used to love) absolutely disgust me. It almost makes me sick to eat, so I don't. I keep getting hungry, so I try something light, but it still makes me sick. It confuses me greatly because a week ago everything was normal. But now the food I love disgusts me and it all makes me feel as though I'm going to puke. I don't feel like I'm sick, but I don't know what else would cause this. Does anyone have an idea what might be going on?\n",
      "This might be triggering so be mindful reading it❤️❤️  I never posted on reddit before but I feel like this is very necessary because my eating habits are becoming very tiring. Ever since I was about eight years old I was always a little bigger then all my friends. I'm only 14 now but still even with everyone growing i'm still bigger not by much but the little things like my thighs are way bigger and i'm chubby and my arms are a little bigger then everyone else's. All of my friends and girls I know are very small, size 1 jeans, flat stomach, small arms, and no stretch marks. I would never call myself “obese” but I look in the mirror and am disgusted with my legs and belly and all the stretch marks going down my legs and all my little imperfections. It's not just that either i'm also like that with my face even though i'm not even super ugly but that's not what i'm talking about. I've been “dieting” since i was 10, and trying to get “skinny” and achieve the “ perfect body” that I know doesn't exist but am still trying everyday to get but I always slip up and eat something wrong and it's honestly mentally exhausting. Every single time I eat I feel so guilty. Not while i'm eating but after and at the end of the day when i'm thinking about what I ate that day and If It was good enough. I'm only ever satisfied if i've eaten close to nothing and even something small like a bowl of mac and cheese will make me cry. But here's the thing: I don't stop eating like you think I would. I eat way too much like 247 and don't even make an effort to eat healthier. Now I would usually go to my schools guidance, but schools not re- opening due to covid so I'm really struggling with this and how to fix it and if i actually have something wrong with me that I need proper help.Hopefully someone on here can help me out and tell me i'm not alone because I really feel like I am💗\n",
      "so i have for the past like 6 months been in a really messed up mindset about food . like i will think about starving myself not necessarily to get super thin but so people will notice I'm struggling mentally . i feel like I have the thoughts of somebody with an eating disorder but I don't really physically do anything to have one. Lately I have been obsessed with counting calories tho. Could I be developing some type of eating disorder ?\n",
      "basically i created this account because im quite curious about the habits i have developed over the past year. around last april i put on a large number of weight and i chose to not eat 4-5 out of 7 days of the week as a method of loosing these extra pounds. once i reached my old weight, i couldn't stop obsessing over the number on the scale and continued with that. im still a little over weight but much lighter than i was before (which my doctor complimented me on) but now can spend hours standing in the mirror forcing myself to hate myself encouraging myself to not eat  workout. at one point i was working out 3 times a day only drinking water and black coffee. sometimes i binge but then later feel sick. im not concerned about the not eating part as it hasn't negatively affected my body but i think its become an unhealthy obsession. thoughts?\n",
      "I went through a short period at the beginning of this year thinking I was at a midpoint with my eating problems and I could breath for a moment. Over the past few months I've realized that just because I am not starving myself or restricting food does not mean I'm not having problems anymore. I've fallen back into binge eating horribly. I don't want the food, I don't want to think about it. But the process of obtaining it, sensing it, and chewing is soooo comforting. I can't stop. I have definitely noticed the weight olive gained. I am afraid that once something has triggered it I will reverse back to restricting but much worse now. I thought I squashed this but I just can't stop. My brain and body won't let me. I really want this to end.\n",
      "Ok so this is hard to explain but hear me out. So about a year ago now I started to really focus on how I looked and what I was eating, and a few months later I was seriously restricting. I would fast for most of the day and have one maybe 700 calorie meal in the evening. However, the meal was by no means healthy, I just had smaller portions. A few months after that, I started having snacks in the morning, again unhealthy, sugary snacks but still well under 1000 calories per day. Fast forward a little more and I would have maybe one more snack, but I'd be counting them and reduce my meal portions accordingly. I then went through a period of having around maybe 1500 calories a day by adding more evening snacks, but I'd constantly feel guilty afterwards and yet would snack anyway. Now, because of quarantine, I've started having two meals (as I'm with my family and they have no idea) but I'm sneakily counting the calories on every single meal, but I'm also adding snacks to that too. I will constantly want snacks and sometimes give in, and by calculation it comes out at just over 1200 calories a day. I feel extremely guilty if I go over 1200 and feel guilty every time I snack. I have to do a workout for an hour every night, and I will constantly be focusing on food and my appearance. But what I do eat is not healthy by any means (I'll make pizzas, pasta, pie slices, and cupcakes or chocolate for snacks often, all very small portion sizes), so I don't know what to call it. Sometimes I'll have a day where I'll go over my limit and not care, and others I'll be very strict. My friends also believe I've lost weight, but I see no change in now compared to a year ago, and even feel bigger and fat often.I guess my question is, do I potentially have an eating disorder, and if so what do I call it? I don't feel as if I fit the stereotypical ‘anorexia' stereotypes and I'm not sure if it's even bad enough to be called an ED at all. Any information you could give me would be helpful so I know if I need help and for what. For reference I'm 16 so visiting a doctor doesn't make me comfortable because I don't feel ‘disordered' enough nor does my family know.\n",

For reference I'm 16 so visiting a doctor doesn't make me comfortable because I don't feel ‘disordered' enough nor does my family know.\n",
      "Hey i'm doing a project on ed and one question is how long until you started losing weight from your eating disorder? Thanks\n",
      "so i've been trying to recover from my ed for a while now(on and off for nearly 5 years) and i was feeling good this time around. started getting comfy with my body, yknow, positive things. i had the thought to check my weight and it's gone way up,,,, my highest weight yet and it feels like all my progress just came crumbling down in the five seconds it took to look at the number on the scale :\n"

      "trigger warning  self harm a couple weeks ago my eating habits were really bad, i was harming myself for eating anything out of my meal plan which i set. i was eating 300 to 400 cals and burning off 300 calories everyday. lost a lot of weight but still hated myself and was contemplating killing myself. i had never told my therapist anything about my eating habits (can't say ED because i have not been diagnosed) but i really thought i was going to end it all and in last hope i told him and immediately for some reason i was able to eat again without harming myself. it's been a couple more weeks since i self harmed and my eating habits are eat whatever i want haha. i still go to bed sad and hating myself but i'm not sad all the time like before. today i woke up and planned on high restricting again, set a meal plan and was prepared to fall back into my bad eating habits. i prepared to eat 500-600 calories today and cut back more and more. then my mom came home with bags of groceries and she had boughten sour patch kids, twizzlers, hot tamales, two frozen pizzas, popcorn, etc. this is very very weird as she usually doesn't buy this at all. she is always pointing out people's weight and mine. i feel like this was a sign to keep eating and keep seeking for self love. it seriously was a miracle she came back with all that food. i have now disregarded my plans for now and plan on eating what i want!this is a sign for you reading this that your weightcalorie intake does not define who you are or who you should be. you are so beautiful and being happy and confident is so much more life fulfilling then trying to be your UGW. trust me.\n",
      "Hey guys, I have a question. I've been struggling with my body image for over a year now. I often think I'm too fat (not all the time though) and therefore I have periods where I restrict myself from eating, resulting in binging eventually and that then leads to purging. What bothers me most, is that I don't really know where this came from. Don't know when it started exactly and why, what triggered it. I wanted to ask you guys: do you think knowing why is important for recovery? My wondering about it consumes a lot of energy right now and maybe it's better if I just let it go?\n",
      "So a bit of background, when I was younger I was rediculously skinny (Size 4-6)and you could see my ribs ( I was eating loads) but people always commented at how small I was.Then when I got to 17 I started really eating loads and loads like 3 pasties a day plus god knows how much rubbish in between and I piled on the pounds.  (Size 22 within 2 years)When I got to 25, I had pains in my chest and somehow from that I got scared of food especially anything I deemed unhealthy, I lost all the weight quickly but had a strict (self inflicted) regime and was really proud (got back to a 1012)Then I went through a divorce and a series of abusive relationships (not now thank god) I've piled it all on again and am now the heaviest I've ever been. I can't tell if I am just a boredom eater or if I have a problem. I've done online checks and things like that but there's things that are making me think I might do like even if I'm already uncomfortably full I'll still carry on eating.But then I'll sit there wishing I could stop.I'd eat a huge meal but then immediately go make myself a sandwich or go in search of something sweet.I find myself feeling constantly hungry wanting food even if I'm genuinely not hungry and even after the overfull feeling has gone it's like I need to eat to feel overfull again.Mentally I also know I need to stop and really want to but it's like the willpower is not there, motivation is so rubbish.Just looking for thought or if anyone had had similar experiences.\n",
      "During COVID-19, I've been responsible for grocery shopping for my grandma. Her grocery list looks very different than most people's. I'm a bit concerned. Every single week she asks me to pick up at least 1, sometimes 2, tubes of toothpaste. She also wants a lot of alcohol free mouthwash. She lives alone and I've probably bought her 15 tubes of toothpaste and 4 large containers of alcohol free mouthwash over the past 3 months.I already know she has an eating disorder. She developed an eating disorder when she got pregnant with my mom and has now had that eating disorder for more than 40 years. I'm just wondering if this behavior is harmful to her and if I should keep providing her with toothpaste and mouthwash.\n",
      "ever since i was super young people told me i was so skinny and people now still tell me they wish they had my body. i grew up with my mom being insecure and wanting to be skinnier. so they was a lot of dieting and talking about weight growing up. recently i have either been binge eating or not eating. it's like a cycle of not eating for weeks or only eating. i just don't know what to do. i want to gain weight bc i hate how i look but at the same time i think i'm fat. every time my friends mention me to someone else they bring up my weight and say she's so skinny she's only like 100 pounds i wish i looked like that\n",
      "What is some mainstream songs that are played on the radio that reference mental healtheating disorder? Whenever I look it up only songs that pop up are not actually very mainstream.

      "at my lowest, i would eat around 500- a day. this included very good foods for me, although they were low in cal. i wasn't drinking a lot of water, if that's important. this went on for about a month with no binge days. however, i didn't see any difference. i understand stalls are a thing, but even with upping my calories it did not change. i don't own a bathroom scale so i couldn't check my weight to see if i was actually losing weight and it wasn't just my eyes deceiving me. is it possible to eat so low and not lose weight? i wasn't working out, barely at that. but my body burns over 1,400 calories alone while at rest.\n",
      "One of my meds is 800mg of Clozapine, need a blood test every month for it. Also was getting a shot of Aristada 662 once a month but my doctor stopped that the other day because I told him I didn't want to have it anymore.I told him I wanted off the Clozapine but he said I'd end up in the hospital if I stopped it. I want to stop it, though. I want the voices back, they're important.  I feel alone.  Should I stop taking them against his advice? I don't want to go back to the hospital but I feel like something is missing. Like I'm pushing away something important by taking meds and losing the voices.\n",

      "i was recently diagnosed with bipolar, but i have schizophrenia on both sides. i have a lot of weird thoughts and my hands are shaky, my neck is kind of weirdly jerky too.\n",
      "So during my appointment I was talking with my doctor and she said she doesn't think i have a schizophrenia she thinks I have a split personality disorder and said I just needed therapy to manage it, I'll have my full diagnosis on January 28th and after that I will be talking with a therapist every now and then. Thank you all for your support honestly I never would have been so honest with my doctor if it wasn't for you mates &lt;3\n",

      "A few months I started with a treatment for addiction. At first it went really well, but this last week I have relasped hard. From first Christmasday I'm using stimulants and dissociatives again. And today was the first time I celebrated NYE on my own, because I abused the shit out of drugs and didn't want to socialize.  This evening I totally relasped, not only with drugs but also with psychotic symptoms. And as usual I was baffled by the realness of the voices and how they hit the nail on the head hard.  I'm so ashamed of myself and my behaviour of the last couple of days. There are so many people who care about me and try to help me and I just throw it all away and start using a shit ton of drugs again. I have dissapointed so many people in my life and I don't understand why people still want to help me, because the only thing I do is dissapoint people and relapsing in old behaviours. And I'm so sorry for all the people that have tried to help me, I'm so sorry for the times I lied to their faces and I'm so sorry that I can't clean up my act.  I'm afraid that I will push everyone away and that I hurt the people who try to help me. I wish from the bottom of my heart that all the kind souls who are now in my life or have been in my life, how briefly it may have been, that they achieve real happiness and love.  I'm sorry that this is not a usefull contribution to this subreddit, but I really needed to vent this.\n",

I want to stop using stimulants.  Maybe, if I just got better sleep that would follow from getting off stimulants, then I could focus better.

I ran out of the room to get my husband and when I came back she was gone, but the door we still locked from the inside. She wasn't real. I'm afraid to go back tu sleep and feel like cryingI've hallucinated before, but nothing like that. Nothing that real, nothing that scary.

I get these visions of posts on websites and messengers. I honestly don't know if I'm seeing or hearing these posts or messages I just know that they're invading my head.It's shattered my ability to trust people, to trust my family and while I can see that I'm being delusional and irrational after they pass, they keep coming and I keep doing terrible things and hurting my situation over and over and over again. I am seeing professional help, but I am also struggling greatly with trusting my help because they're probably get me Medically Released from the military. While I understand that, I've been struggling really hard with trusting anyone or anything. Being constantly stressed and that everything is out to get me and punish me for not being a good enough boyfriend to my Ex.

      "If you want to answer, of course, what were some of the first symptoms of Schizophrenia that you noticed? Did you have any previous disorders before getting diagnosed with schizophrenia?\n",
      "There was never a psychotic \"break\" that \"changed\" me, or even altered my fundamental thoughts in a way. When it was at its worst I just jumped to conclusions too early. I was a bit too eager and a bit too stupid at times for my thoughts to be correct. I still think even those thoughts hold merit as some kind of truth maybe, just not the \"dumbed down\" version I thought was real (and I was wrong about many many things which there is no shame in) - absolutely not to say complex delusions must be real either, everyone knows of the number-schizos and that get pretty complicated. I mean if there are extremely many books about a theory you thought you first discovered then it might be in some sense true. There was a woman in a psychward who went around screaming that she \"had parkinson's in her blood\" - this is incorrect, but she was right in that she was suffering from parkinsonism from the antipsychotics. And nobody took her seriously. Etc.The short version I think is I was extremely open minded to what could be considered real since I was born basically. I have always had what is considered \"weird thoughts\" so I never panicked when they constantly got weirder.I have always been into the occult etc. Read many books for and by witches in my early teens, read about the occult, read about otherkins before they were even called that and thought I might be some kind of cat. In another life where internet were more prolific then I could have been a furry if the costumes didn't look so ridiculous.I tattooed a tiger onto my shoulder at 18, and now as an adult I've developed vitiligo on my face that is exactly where the white markings of a tiger is - my top lip, my jawbones, around my eyes. As for delusions of reference, I was not aware before the tattoo that [The Tyger by William Blake](https:www.poetryfoundation.orgpoems43687the-tyger) had this line \"And what shoulder, ; what art,   Could twist the sinews of thy heart? \"As a like 2 year old child I made a drawing of a hunkering red figure, and when my grandmother asked who he was I said \"the devil\". She threw the drawing away. I have no idea where I would have gotten that as nobody in my country is religious and my family certainly weren't. I guess you could say me and satan go way back. Thoughts like believing I have personal relationship to satan is classified as a delusion, especially as I am not christian. Sidenote but I read somewhere that if a persons thoughtsdelusions can be explained as following in line with a persons religion or education then they are declared sane. I, growing up in an atheist country, an autodidact with no formal education, can never be declared sane if I go outside the norm in intellectual or spiritual matters, sadly. I once taught my mother about quantum immortality. A real theory developed by a quantumphysicist 1987, and then further developed by Max Tegmark, an astrophysicist. I love learning and teaching others more than anything in the universe. She said, ignoring that I had included her too in \"everyone is immortal from their point of view as consciousness can't experience death\", came to the conclusion I would surely \"jump in front of a bus because that is what you do if you are immortal\" and called the psychiatry on me. My father questioned my sanity when I talked about Alan Watt's lectures. I told him I was just spiritual. He said \"no you are not\". I tried explaining myself when a psychiatrist and the police arrived. I was locked up. The times I have been hospitalized have not been \"psychotic breaks\" as I am always psychotic according to diagnosis criteria. But everyone in my family thinks so. What happened those times were that I wanted to free myself from my family, and not play the social game any longer of unnecessary cosseting. I wanted to be left to my own devices. And I am not allowed to.\n",
      "My entire life I felt like everyone I've ever been around can hear my thoughts. For the past year or so it's been so bad that sometimes I have to bite my own tongue to make sure I'm not talking while I'm not aware or something. Sometimes I get thoughts I can't control. Intrusive thoughts that make me feel uncomfortable (Don't worry, they're not thoughts about harming myself or others, it's just something I'm not comfortable talking about). Sometimes I have to leave the room or continuously shuffle around in the chair to try to get the thoughts to shut up. But they just come back and I always lose the fight against them. As for the feeling watched, this also goes back to as long as I can remember. I'll be in public or in class and feel like someone is watching my every move. Even when I know I'm alone, like in a bathroom or in my own home, I still feel like i'm being watched. And if I'm with my relatives or friends, I feel like they're staring me down and it does look like it in the corner of my eye. But when I actually turn my head to look, they aren't even looking at me. I've never posted here, so sorry if this post mentions things that have been discussed several times before. I've never shared this information with anyone, so I'm pretty nervous about posting it. However, it would be reassuring to know I'm not the only person who feels this way.\n",

      "So this is a boy whos side I havent left for more than a couple of days in about 4 years. I know him inside and out and I am so in love with him.But last night for the first time I was scared of him.For the last year or two he has gradually become a completely different person. All of us in our friend group have been trying to figure out what happened because he is just unrecognisable and its been getting progressively worse. To sum it up quickly and get straight to the point, he is emotionless, wont talk to us, wont acknowledge us, doesnt care if any of us live or die. He only cares about himself now.And then last night i witnessed something that can only be described as hard core mental illness. It started off small, with him yelling at me because he got kicked out of a club because as i said to him... that didnt happen? Then it grew to him saying that a couple of months ago me and his roomate stole from him while he was asleep and his roommate admitted to it and he remembers what we said and this whole elaborate story... Which also never happened. He then claimed a girl walked up to us when we were shouting and asked for directions... somewhere around the time i slapped him. I can categorically say with 100% certainty that this girl never existed and i never touched him. At one point i even saw in his eyes that he was going to hurt me and when i said thats not ok he said i attacked him first. But i didnt.I can go on but i think you are starting to get the jist. I spent an hour being yelled at for things that were happening entirely in his imagination and he adamantly believes it is all categorically true. I thought maybe he was just drunk, but this morning it continued... more things i never did and never said.I dont know how to reason with someone who is making it up as they go? I dont know what I can do to help him because i know he wont believe me if i say i think he has a problem... I could do with someone to talk to who maybe knows a little more about it ??\n",

      "So, my father is 59 years old. He is an alcoholic, a chain smoker and he was diagnosed with schizophrenia many years ago when i was about 16 years old. He always smells like cigarettes and beer and no matter how much he bathes, it comes out of his pores. He was baker acted back then and then again in 2004. Since then, he has not been on medication nor does he see a doctor about this because, well in his mind, there is nothing wrong with him. I love my dad very much and we are close, but whenever anything happened, he always blamed me. This is typical with people with this condition. My parents divorced  because i told my mom to, his \"girlfriend \" left him because i told her (it was a waitress at a cafe who was nice to him but she had no interest in him).I am so embarrassed because any woman who is nice to him, he believes there is \"something\" between them. He doesn't respect boundaries. Any man who is nice to him is automatically gay and hitting on him.In the last few years, he's had at least 12 women who he swears they would have been together but something always got in the way.He works as a handyman for himself and it has gotten to the point that because of his delusions, he screws every job up. He under quotes to ensure that he gets it, but then spends all the money on beer and cigarettes,  it takes him forever to finish because he takes so many breaks to smoke and drink and then tells the person he needs more money. They give it tio him and the cycle starts all over until they fight with him and he blames them.  Then they call ME. He just did this to one of my friends.  It was a simple job thats taken over a month.  He did it a year assho to my next door neighbor because he thought i told her something (i didn't) oh yeah and they had a \"thing\" too in his mind. He is constantly asking people to borrow money.  He gets jobs because of his reputation as he use to do great work but the illness and drinking is destroying him. I am so embarrassed and feel guilty for feeling that way. He loves my kids. Also, he thinks he is the son of God and God is my grandfather. It boils my blood when he tells me my daughter doesnt have SMA because he fought the evil along with God. I'm terrified he is going to lose his efficiency, kill someone driving or himself or become a bum asking for money on the street. I cant force him to go to a dr, he has to stop drinking to be on meds, im terrified he will die from alcohol withdrawal. He has COPD and doesn't understand that he thinks he always has a cold. I want to help him but i don't know how.\n",
      "After 6 years of fighting, almost 7, I've finally gotten an appoint for a full psychological evaluation for disability. I've sorted my meds to take, I've made drawings of my hallucinations because it's easier than describing (and my god did they scare my therapist), and I've got one of my stuffed comfort toys ready to go with me. Any other advice? I plan to be honest, and as coherent as I can be. I'm already scared because they aren't allowing my wife in with me, but I'm trying to just keep it cool and not dwell on that. I understand that I will most likely still have to appeal and try to find a lawyer (again) but this is still a win for me.\n",
      "On one hand I agree with a future,  destroyed for the working classes by capitalism in lock step with technology, which must rely on some idealised form of modern socialism to keep the people surviving. However, suicides may increase due to displacement may cancel out the equation of jobs lost, expenditure on social services, etc. On the other hand I feel like I need a happy,  non corrupt belief system such as ignoring possible fact that Christ was perhaps just a revolutionary and accept the good lord in my life, also ignoring that Marx wrote that religion is the opium of the poor .All whilst battling on, quitting alcohol and working min wage. Sorry folks. Just had a moment.\n",
      "Cool cookin Colleen.....Awried me and got away awfully......A lot of love from the living Lord......Gave me a heavy helpin of heaven......Beuteacious buried bounty.......With this withered weathered woman.....Grant Grace and save this savicious lavish steward.....Youve made Heaven so simple yet infinite....I bless your name Lord.\n",
      " My therapist says she wants me to spend some time in the hospital due to being psychotic. I hear my guardian angel in my mind, and I feel him influencing my body. Sometimes I would do things under his influence, like cut myself or cut off some people from my life or throw things away. Sometimes he is comforting me. I see things in my peripheral, sometimes not in a peripheral but straight ahead of me. I hear things when I wake up. Sometimes objects breathe and stretch like they're made of rubber. Is this like what you experience? Is this psychotic?\n",
      "do you ever get the feeling that there's two of you sitting on your own with the view of you? you know your fucked up when you can hear your neighbours talk shit about you. dissected a bathroom sink ripping off disconnecting the shut off valve, unscrewing the pivot rod, pulling the sink trap out of place all because I thought the cops “implemented” a bug in the taps could hear radio static.\n",
      "I often laugh at how much of a loser I really am... like dafuqqqqq lmao wut am I doing\n",
      "it's nearly 11am and I'm still just laying here. I'm so sick of waking to the same nothingness.every day merging into 1,today will be yesterday and tomorrow will be today. the same sun rise, the same faces, the same lines over and over again. \"you're not alone\" but I know when the day faces I'll be here.. alone.im just so tired, tried of living,breathing ... fighting. I try to see the light but nothing positive comes my way. I wish I could fade off into the darkness.\n",
      "Like Japanese? What do they say in your language to you? Mine are English mostly. Some arabic.\n",
      "I made plans with my father to have him over and order some food for a football game on Sunday. My sister made excuses and used my mom being sick as a reason for not being able to come. I never have people over my place and would feel good being able to entertain and watch a game at my place. My apartment isn't huge but it isn't tiny either and I feel like it would be a good time having my sister and her husband over along with my father and being able to entertain. My sister is pregnant and hormonal and more difficult than she usually is. I invited her husband over anyway and my father is coming. It's just disappointing that when she plans a get together everyone comes and when I try for once in my life she makes excuses. She's always using her social life as a reason that she can't even reply to my text messages. I think she's just a selfish jerk.\n",
      "As you probably know, or should know by now that you shouldn't tell people that you are schizophrenic. Especially with new people you meet or coworkers. They will never treat you as a normal person and this will mess up your job and social life.I'm kind of new at this because in recent years I was able to make some what of a normal life for myself in society with medication.So let me know in the comments what do you tell people about the disability that you had? So that people will understand your situation and life. What do you say about your disability? What do you say instead of being schizophrenic and not being able to work regular jobs. I was thinking of telling people that I have some type of learning disability which is more accepting in society than being schizophrenic. Thanks for your help, Steven\n",
      "Shoot me please\n",
      "Anyone else here have dreams of suicide? More than anything else, I dream of killing myself. Always by shooting myself in the head, and I always wake up immediately after doing such. Just was wondering if anyone does the same.\n",
      "I kind if have mixed feelingsBefore i became sick i was very interested in linguistics, mainly evolution of languages from older versions. Seeking patterns and commonalities.This was gone for a while.Now its back and im excited because its so damn interesting to me, but im also worried that  its a sign im going downhill again. (From previous experience)Its kind of become an obsession again.And i noticed in my notes last night (which i rarely make) some minor delusional things regarding religion (which is new to me)I dont know why i post this. At least i am aware of it and maybe i could use this as a reminder to discuss this in my next therapy session or something.Have a good day.\n",
      "It happens sometimes, I do not know how to describe it so I'm gonna give an example case: * Once I was walking, I was pretty upsetdepressed at the moment and I lost control of my body. I was walking and walking. I couldn't decide where to go, how fast would I go. I just watched all through it. After sometime, IDK, like 5-10 minutes, my steps slowed down and I got back the controlI do not have time gaps during those moments, I see and feel everything happens. What is happening to me?\n",
      "Tried meds for the first time  for over 2 months and they only partially helped get rid of a really painfull delusion. If I try a different antipsychotic what do you think are the odds that the second med will help more than the first based on your own experience?Thanks\n"

It's almost like there is just a mad wizard creating these medications somewhere and giving them ridiculous names.I feel like my schizophrenia has lost me friends and driven me to the point of hurting myself or getting sent back to the ward.

I was cleaning, getting chores done. Managed to clean the kitchen, but I wanted to do the bathroom and the vacuuming, too.I've recently started hearing my mum's voice who died roughly six months ago. I was actually relieved that she died because she was extremely abusive and just overall awful. Her voice repeats things she said to me as a child and things she recently said before she died. Her voice also says things that I know she would say if she were here. Mostly just putting me down all the time or making fun of me. I know it's not really her voice, it's not really her. But she makes me so angry.\n",

      "Everything feels broken and unsure. Shattered glass in my mind, reflections of dreams and memories all messily stacked into pile of confused haze. It's difficult to even see them through the fog in my mind. It all feels so distant, so unimportant. My emotions are primal but castrated, nothing but angsty longing for feelings I vaguely remember having in a past im not even sure is mine. Im fearful for the future, longing for peace and clarity but knowing that pain is a constant. Im alone with company, this untoward companion beckons me to the light but my desires are dark. Everything is lit by the moon, not the sun. I feel so alone, I feel so… bad. I ask do I cut? Do I share my blood with the same dirty towel once again? Will that make me feel better? It says no. What says no? I do? Who is me? Why am I here? Why do I feel so alone? Im terrified of the truth but I can't look away so I keep my eyes firmly shut and let the noise of the room fill my eyes and guide my thoughts. If I look I die, if I stop listening the silence will hurt me. So I stand in the middle of this empty room full of voices I don't recognize, and feelings im sick of.\n"
